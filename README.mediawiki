== Introduction ==

Little Go is an iOS application that lets you play the game of Go on the iPhone
or iPad. You can play against another human, or against the computer. The
minimum requirement for running this version of Little Go is iOS 4.3.

For a detailed description of Little Go's features, see the MANUAL document
(also available in-game from the "Help" tab).

You can check for the most recent version of Little Go in Apple's
[http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/little-go/id490753989?ls=1&mt=8 App Store]. If
you are interested in Little Go as a developer, you can either clone
[https://github.com/herzbube/littlego/ the GitHub repository], or download a
release snapshot of the source code from
[http://www.herzbube.ch/littlego the project website]. Once you have
unpacked the source tar ball you should first read the README.developer
document.


== Changes in this release ==

This is the Little Go feature release 0.9.0. The following major improvements
have been made:

* 3 new settings have been added to profiles (maximum number of playout games,
  maximum thinking time, ponder time). These settings provide much improved
  control over the computer player's playing strength.
* Individual profile settings are now hidden in an "Advanced configuration"
  screen. The user can still tweak those settings if she wants to, but there
  is also a simplified "playing strength" screen where, by selecting a playing
  strength, the user adjusts several profile settings in a single action,
  without having to know the technical details behind each setting.
* The computer player can now be interrupted when it is thinking.
* The user can now choose to send a crash report if the app crashes (available
  when the app is launched the next time after the crash). Settings are
  available on the "Diagnostics" tab. Read the in-game manual for more
  information.
* The user can now send send a bug report email with attached diagnostics
  information file from within the app. The function is available on the
  "Diagnostics" tab. Read the in-game manual for more information.

In addition there have been quite a few bugfixes. As usual the ChangeLog
document has all the details.
