Either way, you should read the quick-start guide in <code>README.developer</code> to get up and running.</p>

<li>On Little Go's <a href="https://trello.com/board/little-go/4fd84c295027333d460dcc32">Trello board</a> you can see what I am currently working on.</li>
<li>Little Go also has an <a href="https://www.ohloh.net/p/littlego">Ohloh page</a> that provides mildly interesting source code statistics.</li>
</ul><h1>Documentation</h1>

<ul>
<li>The source code is documented with Doxygen. The project is set up to generate the documentation with a a premade <code>Doxyfile</code> configuration file and an Xcode target that expects Doxygen and GraphViz to be located in <code>/opt/local/bin</code> (the standard MacPorts path).</li>
<li>A class diagram in the <code>doc</code> folder (a .jpg file) provides an overview of Little Go's core classes. The diagram was created with the free community edition of the UML modeling application <a href="http://astah.net/">Astah</a>. The model itself is in the file <code>littlego.asta</code>.</li>
<li>The end user documentation, which is available from within the game, is in <code>doc/MANUAL</code>.</li>
