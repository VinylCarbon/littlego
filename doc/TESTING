Purpose of this document
------------------------
This document has information about how the project's automated testing
facilities work. It also contains a script for manual testing of most of the
application's features. The intent is to execute the script before a new
version is released to the App Store.


Automated unit tests
--------------------
All unit test related files are located in the top-level folder "test".

The Xcode project defines a target "Unit tests" which builds a unit test bundle.
To make the unit tests build automatically every time the main target is built,
I usually make sure that in all of my Xcode schemes the checkbox "Run" is
checked not only for the main target, but for the unit test target as well.
Note that the same result can also be achieved by a target dependency.

To run the tests, you must manually select the "Product > Test" menu item. It
would be preferrable to run the tests automatically as part of the build, but I
am not aware how this can be achieved in Xcode 5 or later. In Xcode 4.x there
was a built-in script named "RunUnitTests" that could be invoked in a
"Run Script" build phase. In Xcode 5, however, this is no longer working, the
built-in script fails with the error message "RunUnitTests is obsolete."

See NOTES.Build for technical details about the "Unit test" build target.

A final note about logging: The log file for unit tests run in the simulator
environment is located in
~/Library/Application Support/iPhone Simulator/Documents/Logs.


Automated UI tests
------------------
There are currently no automated UI tests for this project. An attempt was made
to implement such tests using the cross-platform test automation framework
Appium [1], but the attempt was aborted because there was simply too much to do
in the limited amount of time that I am willing to spend on this project.

Script for manual testing
-------------------------
Preconditions
- Perform tests on a real device, not in the simulator
- Before testing begins, remove the app bundle from the device under test so
  that all preferences and saved games from previous tests are erased
- Create a build with the "Distribute_AdHoc" configuration and install that
  build on the device
  - Via Xcode, if the device can be physically connected to the build machine.
    Disconnect the device after the build has been installed so that the tests
    are performed without Xcode being attached to the process.
  - Via ad-hoc distribution if the above is not possible. In this case, the
    device UUID must be added to the ad-hoc distribution provisioning profile
    and the provisioning profile must be installed on the device before the test
    build can be installed.
- Unless otherwise noted, tests on devices that support landscape orientation
  (iPad, iPhone 6+) should be made with the device held in landscape orientation


Basic functionality to switch between UI areas of the application
- Launch application
- Briefly activate all UI areas of the application
- In the Settings area check that all user preferences use factory default
  settings
- In the Archive area check that no saved games are present

  properly displayed

  of the app. The main menu view has a title bar with a title "Main Menu" and a

  from each UI area to the list of UI areas.
- Dismiss the main menu

- The UI differs from the UI of smaller iPhones like this:
  - On the left-hand side of the screen is a list with board positions that is
    vertically scrollable
  - Below the list with board positions is the status view
  - On the left and right of the game board are two button boxes
    - On the left: A button box that contains the board position navigation
      buttons
    - On the right: A button box that contains the toolbar buttons, with two
      permanent buttons (Game Info, More Game Actions) at the bottom, and above
      all the remaining buttons
  - The "Menu" button is in the top-right corner of the screen
- Tap the "Menu" button. The main menu view appears that lists all the UI areas
  of the app. The main menu view has a title bar with a title "Main Menu" and a
  back button "Play".
- Check that each UI area can be activated, and that it is possible to return
  from each UI area to the list of UI areas.
- Make sure that you are viewing the list of UI areas
- Rotate the device to portrait. The list of UI areas rotates correctly.
- Dismiss the main menu. The Play UI area is shown with the layout for portrait.
  It is acceptable if the transition from landscape to portrait layout is
  briefly visible.
- Tap the "Menu" button, rotate the device to landscape, then dismiss the main
  menu. The Play UI area is shown with the layout for landscape. Again, it's
  acceptable if the UI update is briefly visible.
- Tap the "Menu" button
- Start a drag gesture by dragging from the left edge of the screen towards the
  right. The Play UI area gradually becomes visible the farther you drag.
- Cancel the gesture by lifting the finger before more than half of the screen
  is covered by the Play UI area. The main menu view slides back into place.
  The title bar with the view title and the back button (which were temporarily
  hidden during the drag gesture) are visible again.


Tab functionality (on those devices that use a tab bar)
- Dismissing "Game info" view
  - Go to Play area
  - Tap the "Game info" button
  - Tap the "Play" tab bar button. This must dismiss the "Game info" view, just
    as if the "back" button had been tapped
