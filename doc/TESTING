Purpose of this document
------------------------
This document contains a script for manual testing of most of the application's
features. The intent is to execute the script before a new version is released
to the App Store.


Preconditions
-------------
- Perform tests on a real device, not in the simulator
- Remove the app bundle from the device under test so that all preferences and
  saved games are erased
- Create a build with the "Distribute" configuration and install that build
  on the device via ad-hoc distribution
  - The "Distribute" configuration is used if the "Little Go Release" scheme
    is active in Xcode and the menu item Product > Archive is selected
  - Also see the section "Xcode schemes" in README.developer for details about
    how to create schemes
- Perform tests while not connected to Xcode


The script
----------
Basic tab functionality
- Launch application
- Briefly activate all tabs
- On the settings tab check that all user preferences use factory default
  settings
- On the archive tab check that no saved games are present
- On the diagnostics tab check the GTP log: The following commands must be
  visible in the log:
  - book_load
  - clear_board
  - boardsize
  - komi
  - commands for applying profile settings (e.g. uct_max_memory)
- On the "More" tab, go through all the documents once and check that they
  are properly displayed
