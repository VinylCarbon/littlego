Purpose of this document
------------------------
This document has information about how the project's automated testing
facilities work. It also contains a script for manual testing of most of the
application's features. The intent is to execute the script before a new
version is released to the App Store.


Automated unit tests
--------------------
All unit test related files are located in the top-level folder "test".

The Xcode project defines a target "Unit tests" which builds a unit test bundle.
To make the unit tests build automatically every time the main target is built,
I usually make sure that in all of my Xcode schemes the checkbox "Run" is
checked not only for the main target, but for the unit test target as well.
Note that the same result can also be achieved by a target dependency.

To run the tests, you must manually select the "Product > Test" menu item. It
would be preferrable to run the tests automatically as part of the build, but I
am not aware how this can be achieved in Xcode 5. In Xcode 4.x there was a
built-in script named "RunUnitTests" that could be invoked in a "Run Script"
build phase. In Xcode 5, however, this is no longer working, the built-in script
fails with the error message "RunUnitTests is obsolete."

Notes about the "Unit test" target:
- All tests in this target are what Apple used to call "logic tests", i.e. unit
  tests exercise more or less isolated classes. The test source code is built
  using the iOS Simulator SDK, and tests can be run within the simulator only,
  i.e. not on a real iOS device, and also not outside of the simulator (the
  latter differs from Xcode 4.x where it was possible to run tests without
  launching the simulator)
- All source code files that are unit tested must be added to the "Unit test"
  target so that they are built for that target.
- The build setting "Header Search Path" is set to the value "./src". Since the
  test sources are completely separated from the normal application sources, I
  don't want to deal with relative path issues for each #import statement. The
  application can be seen as third party software from the point of view of the
  unit test bundle.
- Because application source files depend on the presence of a prefix header,
  the "Unit test" target has to have the same "Prefix header" build settings
  as the main application target.
- Compiling ApplicationDelegate usually pulls in Fuego/Boost (via GTP classes)
  as dependencies. To prevent this, the "Unit test" target defines the
  preprocessor macro LITTLEGO_UNITTESTS. The effect is that certain #include
  statements and pieces of code are not compiled and the dependency on
  Fuego/Boost goes away.

A final note about logging: The log file for unit tests run in the simulator
environment is located in
~/Library/Application Support/iPhone Simulator/Documents/Logs.


Automated UI tests
------------------
There are currently no automated UI tests for this project. An attempt was made
to implement such tests using the cross-platform test automation framework
Appium [1], but the attempt was aborted because there was simply too much to do
in the limited amount of time that I am willing to spend on this project.

Script for manual testing
-------------------------
Preconditions
- Perform tests on a real device, not in the simulator
- Before testing begins, remove the app bundle from the device under test so
  that all preferences and saved games from previous tests are erased
- Create a build with the "Distribute_AdHoc" configuration and install that
  build on the device
  - Via Xcode, if the device can be physically connected to the build machine.
    Disconnect the device after the build has been installed so that the tests
    are performed without Xcode being attached to the process.
  - Via ad-hoc distribution if this is not possible. In this case, the device
    UUID must be added to the ad-hoc distribution provisioning profile and the
    provisioning profile must be installed on the device before the test build
    can be installed.
- Unless otherwise noted, tests on the iPad should be made with the device held
  in landscape orientation


Basic tab functionality
- Launch application
- Briefly activate all tabs
- On the settings tab check that all user preferences use factory default
  settings
- On the Archive tab check that no saved games are present
- On the Diagnostics tab check that the GTP log contains no failed commands
- On the "More" tab, go through all the documents once and check that they
  are properly displayed

  Play tab
  - The navgation bar contains a "back" button and a segmented control with the
    following segments: Score, Game, Board
  - The "Score" segment is selected
- Select the "Game" segment. Check that the information presented matches the
  factory defaults: No handicap, board size 9, komi 7.5, simple ko rule, area
  scoring, black player is "Anonymous", white player is "Fuego", active profile
  is "Default profile".
- Tap "back" to dismiss the "Game info" view; the view slides away to once more
  reveal the game board and other UI elements of the Play tab
