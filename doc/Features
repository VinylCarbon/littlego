Purpose of this document
------------------------
This document provides a description of the features of the application.

Before development for a new feature or set of features begins, a description of
how the feature is supposed to work should be noted down in this document. The
description should not be too technical, and it should focus on how the user
perceives the feature to work. After writing down the description, it can then
serve as a guideline for the development effort.

If this document is kept up-to-date, it also serves as an informal reference,
e.g. to get going again after a longer break between development cycles. Keep in
mind that this document is NOT intended to be a manual. If it threatens to
become one, convert it into a proper MANUAL file.

Working with .sgf files
-----------------------
- Saved games are available for syncing in iTunes
  - To achieve this, save game files are stored in the application's document
    folder
- The Archive view on the "Archive" tab lists previously saved games and
  provides the means to manage them as follows
  - Existing files are listed in a table view
  - The user can switch between different sorting criteria and sort orders
  - Available sorting criteria are file name and file date
  - Available sort orders are ascending and descending
  - The user can enter a search string to filter the list
  - The user can delete files by entering the table view's editing mode (a
    standard iOS feature)
  - Tapping the entry for a file drills down into the detail view for that file
  - Information on the detail view is filesystem related only; in a future
    release the detail view might also display data from within the .sgf file
  - The detail view offers options to load a game and to rename the game file
  - If the user attempts to rename a file and another file with the new name
    already exists, the rename operation fails. The user is informed about the
    problem via an alert view.
- Loading a game works as follows
  - The operation is initiated from the detail view, when a saved game is viewed
    on the Archive view
  - Overall, the procedure to load a game is very similar to starting a new
    game on the Play view
  - The user is presented with the choice of players that should be used for
    the game that is about to be loaded
  - The user cannot choose board size, Komi or Handicap, as these parameters
    are part of the saved game
  - If a game is already in progress, the user is asked to confirm that the
    game in progress will be abandoned
  - If the user confirms loading of the game, the "loadsgf" command is sent to
    the GTP engine
  - The application then queries the GTP engine to gather all the information
    it needs to start a new game (e.g. board size)
  - The application then starts the new game and switches to the Play view
- Saving the current game works as follows
  - The operation is initiated from the Play view on the "Play" tab
  - The option is available as soon as a new game has started
  - The user must enter a filename
  - The file extension .sgf (Smart Game Format) is not enforced
  - The application provides a sensible default filename that can be simply
    accepted
  - If a file already exists, the user is presented with the choice to
    overwrite the file
  - If saving the game proceeds, the "savesgf" command is sent to the GTP engine
  - The application remains on the Play view
