Purpose of this document
------------------------
This document provides a description of the features of the application.

Before development for a new feature or set of features begins, a description of
how the feature is supposed to work should be noted down in this document. The
description should not be too technical, and it should focus on how the user
perceives the feature to work. After writing down the description, it can then
serve as a guideline for the development effort.

If this document is kept up-to-date, it also serves as an informal reference,
e.g. to get going again after a longer break between development cycles. Keep in
mind that this document is NOT intended to be a manual. If it threatens to
become one, convert it into a proper MANUAL file.

Working with .sgf files
-----------------------
- The Archive view on the "Archive" tab provides the means to save the current
  game to an .sgf file, or to load a previously saved game from an .sgf file
- Files are stored in the application's document folder
- The file extension .sgf is not enforced
- Loading a game works as follows
  - Overall, the procedure to load a game is very similar to starting a new
    game on the Play view
  - If a game is already in progress, the user is asked to confirm that the
    game in progress will be abandoned
  - The user is then presented with the choice of players that should be used
    for the game that is about to be loaded
  - The user cannot choose Komi or Handicap, as these parameters are part of
    the saved game
  - If the user confirms loading of the game, the "loadsgf" command is sent to
    the GTP engine
  - The application then queries the GTP engine to gather all the information
    it needs to start a new game (e.g. board size)
  - The application then starts the new game (without the usual resetting of
    the GTP engine) and switches to the Play view
- Saving the current game works as follows
  - The option is available as soon as the first move has been played
  - The user must enter a filename
  - The application provides a sensible default filename that can be simply
    accepted
  - If a file already exists, the user is presented with the choice to
    overwrite the file
  - If saving the game proceeds, the "savesgf" command is sent to the GTP engine
  - The application remains on the Archive view
- Existing files are managed as follows
  - Existing files are listed in a table view
  - The user can switch been different sorting criteria and sort orders
  - Available sorting criteria are file name and file date
  - Available sort orders are ascending and descending
  - The user can enter a search string to filter the list
  - Tapping the entry for a file drills down into the detail view for that file
  - Information on the detail view is filesystem related only; in a future
    release the detail view might also display data from within the .sgf file
  - The detail view offers options to rename and delete the file
  - If a file is renamed and another file with the new name already exists, the
    user is presented with the choice to overwrite the file
  - The user must confirm deletion of a file
- Saved games are available for syncing in iTunes
