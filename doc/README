What is it?
-----------
Little Go is an iOS application that lets you play the game of Go on the iPhone
or iPad. You can play against another human, or against the computer.

For a detailed description of Little Go's features, see the MANUAL document
(also available in-game from the "Help" tab).

You can check for the most recent version of Little Go in Apple's app store. If
you are interested in Little Go as a developer, you can download the source
code from the project website http://www.herzbube.ch/littlego. Once you have
unpacked the source tar ball you should first read the README.developer
document.


Changes in this release
-----------------------
This is Little Go 0.7.

This release adds no new features, but fixes a couple of serious bugs. Other
than that, the main work that has been done is the addition of artwork such as
an application icon, and in-game icons for the tab bar and the toolbar on the
game view.

As usual the ChangeLog document has all the details.


Known bugs
----------
Loading a game on a large board and with many moves takes much too long.

A game cannot be loaded if the computer is currently thinking (either for
itself, or on behalf of a human player who has triggered the "play for me"
function).


License and source code
-----------------------
Little Go is released under the Apache License (2.0). You should have received a
copy of the license along with the Little Go application bundle or the source
distribution (see the file LICENSE inside the application bundle or source
distribution, or start the application and choose the "More:Apache License"
tab item). If not, see <http://www.apache.org/licenses/>.


Platforms
---------
Currently Little Go is available for the iPhone only. Later on, an iPad version
is planned as well.

The minimum requirement for running this version of Little Go is iOS 4.3.

It might be possible to make a build for earlier versions of iOS, but unless
someone requests it I won't spend any time on this.

Some features may not work correctly on devices that are not multitasking
capable. One known instance is that the game currently in progress is not saved
when the application is terminated.
