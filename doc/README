What is it?
-----------
Little Go is an iOS application that lets you play the game of Go on the iPhone
or iPad. You can play against another human, or against the computer.

There is no MANUAL or other document with a more detailed description of Little
Go's features - just try it out, it should all be pretty intuitive.

You can check for the most recent version of Little Go in Apple's app store. If
you are interested in Little Go as a developer, you can download the source
code from the project website http://www.herzbube.ch/littlego. Once you have
unpacked the source tar ball you should first read the README.developer
document.


Changes in this release
-----------------------
This is Little Go 0.3.

The two most important new features in this release are support for saving and
loading of games, and an option that allows memory consumption of the GTP engine
to be limited so that the system does not kill the application because it uses
up too much memory.

For more details see the ChangeLog document.


Known bugs
----------
Loading a game on a large board and with many moves takes much too long.

If the application is launched and automatically starts a human vs. human game,
memory consumption of the GTP engine will not be limited. The technical reason
for this is that no computer player was involved in the game. As soon as a game
that involves a computer player is started, that computer player's memory
consumption limit will be applied - and will remain in force (!) until the
application is killed, or a different limit is applied.


License and source code
-----------------------
Little Go is released under the Apache License (2.0). You should have received a
copy of the license along with the Little Go application bundle or the source
distribution (see the file LICENSE inside the application bundle or source
distribution, or start the application and choose the "More:Apache License"
tab item). If not, see <http://www.apache.org/licenses/>.


Platforms
---------
Currently Little Go is available for the iPhone only. Later on, an iPad version
is planned as well.

The minimum requirement for running this version of Little Go is iOS 4.2.

It might be possible to make a build for earlier versions of iOS, but unless
someone requests it I won't spend any time on this.


Special Thanks
--------------
The Fuego project and its developers, for creating a freely usable Go engine
in the first place, but also for encouraging me to use their engine despite
some legal uncertainties regarding the LGPL license.

Sen:te, for creating the beautiful app Goban (http://www.sente.ch/software/goban/)
and making it available free of charge. Goban is one of my much-loved Mac OS X
applications, and for a long time I had hoped that it would be ported to iOS.
Unfortunately, this never happened, so I had to come up with something of my
own - the result is Little Go. Although Little Go will never match Goban in
terms of style, elegance and execution, you might recognize one or two
similarities between the two programs :-)

The Sensei's Library (http://senseis.xmp.net/), for providing a wealth of
information on Go that I could consult whenever I had any doubts about one of
the rules and concepts of the game.

The two iPhone apps Tetsuki and Goban (the latter not by Sen:te), for
inspiration how to design certain aspects of Little Go's user interface.
