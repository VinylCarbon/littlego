Sun September 25 2011   "Patrick Näf" <herzbube@herzbube.ch>
- release of version 0.3
- features
  - computer players now have a set of GTP engine attributes that allow to
    limit memory consumption and, to a certain degree, playing strength
  - game archive
    - a game in progress can now be saved
    - existing games can be managed on a separate "Archive" tab
    - the game archive is accessible from iTunes so that archived games can be
      transferred to/from the iOS device when it is connected to iTunes
  - the game in progress is auto-saved when the application is put into the
    background so that the game is not lost if the application is subsequently
    killed for any reason
  - Play view now uses a grey instead of a b/w color scheme
- bugfixes
  - by default the GTP engine now uses 64 MB memory only; on an iPhone 3GS with
    256 MB memory this limit is sufficient that the system no longer kills the
    application because it uses up too much memory
  - application no longer hangs if GTP engine responds with error to final_score
  - capturing moves with a single stone now work correctly
  - pass moves are no longer drawn on the Go board
  - toolbar buttons on Play view now use an explicit text label instead of
    confusing icons
- technical changes
  - less view updates on the Play view, which means less power consumption and
    slightly snappier panning
  - add command processor design pattern
  - GTP commands can now be executed synchronously
