  - The name of the "iPhone 4S" demo profile has been changed to "Strong" (#210)
  - The "long press" gesture for placing a stone now has a slightly longer
    delay (#241). This should make it less likely that the user places a stone
    when instead she wanted to scroll.
- Bugfixes
  - Drawing for Retina displays has been fixed (#205). Many thanks to
    Eric O. Lebigot for reporting the issue and giving me the necessary KITB to
    investigate the problem.
  - The app no longer crashes when the "Score" segment is visible on the
    "Game Info" screen and player/profile information is edited (#225)
  - The app no longer crashes when a player is viewed on the "Game" segment of
    the "Game Info" screen and the game ends (#226)
  - The app no longer crashes when a saved game is renamed and the new name
    contains illegal characters (#235)
  - iPad: The list of board positions now shows the correct move after
    discard & play (#233)
  - iPhone: Potential app crash eliminated if user taps an entry in the list of
    board positions (#229)
  - Handicap compensation is now shown in the "Game info" screen even if scoring
    mode is not enabled (#220)
  - The "Minimum number of games" setting in the resign behaviour advanced
    settings screen is no longer editable if the "Auto-select" setting is turned
    on (#207)
  - When the board is zoomed in or out, the internally managed zoom scale can no
    longer become lower/higher than the intended minimum/maximum (#139)
- Regressions
  - The "Load" button on the Archive tab is now disabled again while the
    computer is thinking (#227). This was broken when document interaction was
    introduced in 0.11.0.
- Technical changes
  - Memory usage during zooming has been greatly reduced (#212, #214, #215)
  - Memory usage for wooden background image has been reduced (#216)
  - The project has been upgraded to the iOS 7 SDK (#204) and Xcode Xcode 5.1.1
  - Support for iOS 6 has been dropped, the minimum required version is now iOS
    7.0. Devices that are no longer supported are the iPhone 3GS and the
    iPod Touch 4th generation.
  - The user interface now uses Auto Layout instead of manually calculated
    frames (#206)
  - Unit tests were migrated from SenTestingKit/OCUnit to XCTest (#222)
  - No longer use any .xib files, the entire UI is now set up programmatically
- A list of all issues closed for this release is available on GitHub:

Mon January 06 2014   "Patrick Näf" <herzbube@herzbube.ch>
- Release of version 1.0.0
- Features
  - When a new game is started, it is now possible to select one of several ko
    rules. Simple ko remains the default, new choices are positional and
    situational superko (#169).
  - When a new game is started, it is now possible to select whether area or
    territory scoring should be in effect (#30). Area scoring is the default
    because the computer player (Fuego) does not properly support territory
    scoring.
  - During scoring it is now possible to mark stones in seki (#190). Tap the
    "Actions" button to find the menu entry that lets you switch from
    "mark dead stones" to "mark stones in seki".
  - It is now possible to display player influence, aka territory statistics,
    for an estimate who owns an area (#18). The feature can be enabled under
    "Settings > Display > Display player influence".
- Other improvements and changes
  - Some of the sections on the "Settings" tab have been re-organized (#132)
  - Attempting to play an illegal move now displays the reason why the move is
    illegal (#182). Examples are suicide, ko or superko.
  - When a new game is started and a handicap is selected, komi is adjusted
    automatically to 0.5 (#189)
  - The computer player's strength has improved because a new version of Fuego
    has been integrated into Little Go. It is not possible to quantify the
    improvement against human opponents, but if the new and the old versions of
    Fuego play against each other, the new version wins 80% - 90% of the games.
  - Use pattern-based additive knowledge on devices with more than 512 MB memory
    (#187).
- Bugfixes
  - iOS 7: The app no longer crashes on startup after a game has been imported
    from an external app such as Mail or DropBox (#184)
  - The app no longer crashes when game is loaded while "Game Info" screen is
    displayed (#191)
  - The app no longer hangs after launch if it was previously suspended/killed
    during scoring (#203)
  - The maximum zoom scale has been reduced to 2.0 for iPad devices, and to 2.5
    for iPhone devices (#202). The previous maximum zoom scale 3.0 was too high,
    causing crashes on most devices.
  - The next stone marker "A" is no longer displayed after all moves have been
    discarded (#200)
  - The "Start of the game" board position table view cell no longer has a wrong
    background color (#199)
  - The "Delete all games" button on the "Archive" tab is no longer affected by
    edit mode (#185)
  - A sliding gesture no longer puts the entire "Players & Profiles" screen into
    edit mode (#175)
  - A number of memory leaks were fixed (#188 and other, smaller fixes)
- Technical changes
  - The project has been upgraded to Xcode 5.0 (#183)
  - Support for iOS 5 has been dropped, the minimum required version is now
    iOS 6.1 (#198). Devices that are no longer supported are iPad 1st generation
    and iPod Touch 3rd generation.
  - The 3rd party software build process has been completely rewritten (#92)
  - All 3rd party software have been upgraded to newest versions
    (Fuego trunk r1728, Boost 1.55.0, MBProgressHUD 0.8, Cocoa Lumberjack 1.7.0,
    ZipKit 1.0.2, QuincyKit 2.1.9)

Mon September 09 2013   "Patrick Näf" <herzbube@herzbube.ch>
- Release of version 0.12.0
- Features
  - It is now possible to configure the computer player with a threshold how
    quickly it will resign a game (#133). For instance, it is now possible to
    tell the computer player to never resign so that the game can be played out
    to the very end. This also allows beginners to play with a large handicap on
    a small board (up until now the computer player would always resign
    immediately when faced with an overwhelming handicap). The resignation
    behaviour setting can be found towards the bottom on the "edit profile"
    screen.
  - When an old board position is viewed, the intersection where the next stone
    will be placed is now marked with the letter "A" (#101). This can be
    disabled in the "Board position" settings.
  - Changes to the active profile are now immediately applied to the GTP engine
    (#123). For instance, it is now possible to change the playing strength or
    the resign behaviour of the computer player without starting a new game.
  - At the bottom of the "Archive" tab there is now a button to delete all
    archived games in one fell swoop (#55)
  - The tab order can now be customized (#57)
  - Players & profiles can now be reset to their factory defaults (#54), in case
    some severe misconfiguration occurred
  - Players & profiles can now be edited directly from the Game Info screen
    (#122)
- Other improvements and changes
  - Loading a game from the archive is now about 10% faster (#166)
  - The user interface for changing the dangerous "Max. memory" profile setting
    is now vastly improved (#153). The maximum value that can be selected for
    the setting is now limited to a fraction of the device's physical memory,
    and the amount of physical memory that the device has is also displayed.
  - When a computer player is edited, there is now a button that allows to
    directly edit the profile that the player is using (#71)
  - When a profile is edited, the players that are using the profile are now
    listed at the bottom of the screen (#70)
  - The button to reset predefined GTP commands is now clearly marked with a
    "red warning" style (#56)
  - The "About" screen now displays the build date/time (#161)
- Bugfixes
  - The GTP engine is configured to no longer recognize positional superko
    (#171). This is a temporary solution to bring the GTP engine's rules into
    sync with Little Go's rules. Little Go currently does not recognize superko,
    so this sync'ing fixes the problem that Little Go lets the user make a
    superko move which is then rejected by the GTP engine. Many thanks to Brid
    Griffin for emailing me a bug report that helped me with diagnosing this
    problem! Note that Little Go will officially support superko in 1.0.
  - On the iPad, the board size is now correct after the device is rotated while
    the board is zoomed (#162)
  - Dragging a stone outside the zoomed in board section no longer places the
    stone (#143)
  - The computer player now resigns even if the profile setting "Max. games" is
    set to a value < 5000 (#154)
  - Undo resign is no longer possible when viewing an old board position. This
    fixes the problem that undo resign when viewing an old board position
    corrupts the backup .sgf (#158).
  - If the game has ended but an old board position is viewed, the status view
    now shows information related to the board position instead of end-of-game
    information (#107)
  - Scoring mode is no longer activated automatically when a player resigns. The
    effect is that the status now reads "x has resigned" instead of the
    inappropriate "y wins by ..." (#4). If a score is desired it must be
    requested by manually activating scoring mode.
  - The user can no longer place a stone on behalf of the computer player (#160)
  - The board position can no longer be changed while Fuego is searching for
    an initial set of dead stones during scoring (#163)
  - A number of potential app crashes have been eliminated (#130, #172, #173)

Mon May 20 2013   "Patrick Näf" <herzbube@herzbube.ch>
- Release of version 0.11.1
- Bugfixes
  - Board position can no longer be changed while other commands are executed
    (#156). This hard-to-find bug caused numerous crashes (e.g. those described
    by issues #128 and #129) and other problems, such as the infamous
    "The computer played an illegal move." alert. Many thanks to Logan Bouia and
    Carole Wolf for emailing me bug reports that helped me with diagnosing the
    problem.
  - The entire game is now saved when an old board position is viewed (#150)
  - The app should no longer crash after receiving a memory warning on iOS 5
    while the "Game info", "New game" or "Save game" screens are displayed
    (#157). Thanks to the anonymous iPad 1 user who patiently reminded me that
    the issue needs fixing by sending an occasional crash report.
  - Fix for a memory leak in TableViewSliderCell (#155)

Sat Apr 20 2013   "Patrick Näf" <herzbube@herzbube.ch>
- Release of version 0.11.0
- Features
  - Display coordinate labels (#12). This can be turned on or off under
    "Settings > Play view > Display coordinates".
  - Display move numbers (#17). The user preference can be found under
    "Settings > Play view > Display move numbers". Because displaying many move
    numbers is cluttering the board, the percentage of move numbers to display
    can be adjusted with a slider.
  - Zoom the board up to a 3x zoom scale (#16). All standard zoom gestures are
    supported. Because zooming costs memory the user may want to limit herself
    to a maximum zoom scale that is below 3x. This can be done with the slider
    found under "Settings > Play view > Maximum zoom". A limit of 2x zoom scale
    is recommended for devices that do not have much RAM (typically older
    devices such as the iPhone 3GS or the iPad 1st generation).
  - Archived games can now be exported to Mail (#19) and other apps that are
    capable of processing .sgf files (e.g. DropBox).
  - Games can now be imported from Mail (#20) and other apps that are capable
    of exporting .sgf files (e.g. DropBox).
- Other improvements and changes
  - The application now launches much faster (#114), except for the first time
    after upgrading from a previous version.
  - Status text and activity indicator are now displayed in the navigation bar
    at the top of the screen (#120).
  - When a new game is started, the "discard old game" question is not displayed
    anymore if there have been no changes since the game was saved the last
    time (#42).
  - Loading a game from the archive is now about 10% faster (commit 139bb46).
  - Drawing of Go board now makes better use of the available space. This is
    especially noticeable for the large 19x19 board on a small iPhone screen
    (commit 86443d9).
  - The "stone distance from fingertip" user preference now behaves more
    predictably: Previously a "clever" algorithm tried to figure out the "best"
    distance by taking into account various parameters such as board size and
    screen size. The new algorithm now simply scales a fixed maximum distance
    according to the value of the slider.
- Bugfixes
  - No longer crash when a computer vs. computer game is restored during app
    launch and that game has already ended (#127). Thanks to Serge Grossenbacher
    for reporting this bug.
  - No longer draw in secondary thread during app launch (#117). This eliminates
    another potential source of crashes.
  - iPad only: Screen should no longer be flickering wildly after loading some
    games from the archive (#126).
  - It is now possible to save games with a name that consists of 1 or 2
    characters (#125).
  - Resigning is no longer possible when viewing an old board position. This
    fixes the problem that resigning when viewing an old board position corrupts
    the backup .sgf (#115).
  - During scoring, the activity indicator is now only displayed for finding
    the initial set of dead stones (#121).
- Known bugs
  - App may crash when board position is changed (possibly forward going only)
    (#128)
  - App crashes when user plays an illegal move while viewing an old board
    position (#129)
  - App crashes during launch after a player has been deleted (#130)
- Technical changes
  - MBProgressHUD upgraded to the newest version (HEAD of the git repository).
    The progress indicator is now a round shape instead of a horizontal bar.
  - Private Objective-C method declarations in .m files have been removed to
    reduce unnecessary code duplication (#102).

Fri Mar 01 2013   "Patrick Näf" <herzbube@herzbube.ch>
- Release of version 0.10.0
- Improve graphic design
  - Add wooden background
  - Add artwork for black/white/cross-hair stones (instead of just drawing
    filled circles)

    distinguish it from the new "forward" button
- Features
  - View board positions for moves played earlier during the game
  - Replace "undo" with "discard move"
  - A game that has ended can now be resumed in two ways:
    - Discard the most recent move if two pass moves were played by mistake
    - Select "Undo resign" from the game actions menu after accidentally
      resigning the game
  - Redesign of "New game" and "Game info" screens
  - New user preferences
    - Settings > Play view > Stone distance from fingertip
    - Setting > Board position > Discard future moves alert
    - Settings > Scoring > Score when game ends
  - Add support for collecting logging data
    - Turn this on under Diagnostics > Collect logging data
    - Logging data is automatically included in a bug report
  - Do not trigger the computer player when a computer vs. computer game is
    restored on app launch
  - Add placeholder message to "Archive" tab if there are no saved games
  - Various other small GUI updates and fixes
- Bugfixes
  - App no longer crashes if a computer vs. computer game is paused and the
    computer passes or resigns
  - Diagnostics > Bug report section is no longer disabled when computer player
    resigns
  - Fix various memory leaks
  - GUI updates during long-running actions (e.g. app launch, load game) should
    now happen always in the main thread; besides smoother GUI updates, this
    should eliminate one more possible source of crashes
- Known bugs
  - The resigned state of a game is lost when a game is saved or loaded; this
    is not new in this release, it's just been added to the list of known bugs
- Technical changes
  - Upgrade project to Xcode 4.6
  - Drop support for iOS 4.3, the minimum required version is now iOS 5.0
  - Add iOS 6 compatibility
  - Add iPhone 5 support

Sun Dec 22 2012   "Patrick Näf" <herzbube@herzbube.ch>
- Release of version 0.9.2
- Bugfixes
  - Fix for crash if Play tab is not visible and low memory conditions occur
    (issue #86)
  - Fix for crash if an error occurs while loading an archived game, e.g.
    because the game contains an illegal move (issue #88)
  - Fix for crash when Little Go thinks that a move made by the computer player
    is illegal. Note that the root cause of the problem has not yet been
    identified, but at least the app no longer crashes when the condition
    occurs. Instead you will be asked to submit a bug report (please do!), the
    game in progress is automatically saved to the archive and a new game is
    started to bring the app back into a stable state. This temporary solution
    will remain in place until I can track down and fix the actual bug
    (issue #90).
  - Fix for memory leak that occurs when the Game Info view has been selected
    on the Play tab, but the Play tab is not visible and low memory conditions
    occur (issue #87)
  - Fix for memory leak when a bug report is sent (issue #91)
  - Fix for GUI update errors on Play tab after an error occurs while loading a
    game (issue #89)

Sun Dec 09 2012   "Patrick Näf" <herzbube@herzbube.ch>
- Release of version 0.9.1
- Bugfixes
  - Another bug in the Ko detection logic is now fixed. For instance the
    following sequence: Black A2, White B2, Black pass, White C1, Black pass,
    White A1. If Black now tries to capture on B1, this was erroneously thought
    to be illegal due to Ko.
- Technical changes
  - The project's bugtracker is now hosted on GitHub
    (https://github.com/herzbube/littlego/issues)

Fri Nov 23 2012   "Patrick Näf" <herzbube@herzbube.ch>
- Release of version 0.9.0
- Features
  - 3 new settings have been added to profiles (maximum number of playout games,
    maximum thinking time, ponder time). These settings provide much improved
    control over the computer player's playing strength.
  - Individual profile settings are now hidden in an "Advanced configuration"
    screen. The user can still tweak those settings if she wants to, but there
    is also a simplified "playing strength" screen where, by selecting a playing
    strength, the user adjusts several profile settings in a single action,
    without having to know the technical details behind each setting.
  - The computer player can now be interrupted when it is thinking.
  - The user can now choose to send a crash report if the app crashes (available
    when the app is launched the next time after the crash). Settings are
    available on the "Diagnostics" tab. Read the in-game manual for more
    information.
  - The user can now send send a bug report email with attached diagnostics
    information file from within the app. The function is available on the
    "Diagnostics" tab. Read the in-game manual for more information.
  - The Game Info view now displays the currently active profile.
- Bugfixes
  - Loading an .sgf file with bad content no longer crashes the app. Thanks to
    Andrew Hersee for reporting this bug.
  - iPhone only: The Status line is now 2 lines high and no longer truncates
    texts. Thanks to Andrew Hersee for reporting this bug.
  - Improved protection against data loss after a crash (preferences data is
    saved more often, and the game in progress is saved after every move).
    Thanks to Tripp Lilley for reporting this bug.
  - It is no longer possible to enter empty profile and player names
  - iPad only: The Go board is now properly resized when the interface
    orientation changes while the "Play" tab is not visible
  - Display an error message when an illegal save game name is entered (instead
    of just silently not saving the game)
- Technical changes
  - The project's source code is now hosted on GitHub
    (https://github.com/herzbube/littlego/)
  - The project now has a Trello board where you can see what is currently being
    worked on (https://trello.com/board/little-go/4fd84c295027333d460dcc32)
  - An Ohloh page now provides mildly interesting source code statistics
    (https://www.ohloh.net/p/littlego)

Tue June 12 2012   "Patrick Näf" <herzbube@herzbube.ch>
- Release of version 0.8.1
- Features
  - New application icon
  - Added "Quick Start Guide" section to in-game help
- Bugfixes
  - A bug in a low-level function, which has been present in all versions of
    Little Go since its initial App Store release, has finally been found and
    exterminated. The bug caused "Undo" to not work correctly in certain
    situations. The error, when it manifested, did not have an immediate visible
    impact in the GUI, instead it caused all sorts of follow-up problems to
    occur (capturing stones might not work, suicide moves might be allowed,
    marking dead stones in scoring mode might not work correctly, and in some
    extreme cases it might even cause the app to crash).

Tue April 17 2012   "Patrick Näf" <herzbube@herzbube.ch>
- release of version 0.8.0
- features
  - iPad version with support for retina display and all interface orientations
  - iPhone now supports upside-down portrait orientation
  - improved in-game help
- bugfixes
  - loading a game is now much faster
  - drawing, especially while moving a stone around the board, now uses 10-15%
    less CPU power, which improves battery life
  - Ko is no longer erroneously detected in certain situations (e.g. black has
    stones on A2, B1, B3, C1, C3, white has stones on B2 and C2; black now plays
    on D2, white on B2; in this situation, black C2 was erroneously thought to
    be illegal due to Ko)
  - profiles: "reuse subtree" is now always enabled (and cannot be disabled)
    when pondering is enabled; previously the two settings were independent of
    each other, which was a bug
  - loading archived game now works even if temporary file is still around for
    some reason
- technical changes
  - rewrite of Play view drawing code
  - lots of new unit tests
  - upgrade to iOS SDK 5.1

Tue January 3 2012   "Patrick Näf" <herzbube@herzbube.ch>
- release of bugfix version 0.7.1
- bugfixes
  - loading a game with no moves is now handled correctly (previously the app
    would hang and needed to be manually killed to get into a usable state
    again)
  - capturing moves that "almost" create a Ko are now correctly recognized as
    legal moves (e.g. black A1, white A2, black D1, white B2, black C2,
    white C1, previously the black move on B1 was thought to be illegal)
  - it is no longer possible to place stones outside the board in the top-left
    and top-right corners
  - board size 7x7 no longer allows handicaps greater than 4 (selecting such
    a handicap previously would result in no handicap being set at all)

  - enabling scoring mode in mid-game made further game play impossible; this
    has been fixed
- technical changes
  - eliminated various memory leaks
  - application startup now mostly happens in a secondary thread; this makes
    it possible to run the application through Instruments

    limit memory consumption and, to a certain degree, playing strength
  - game archive
    - a game in progress can now be saved
    - existing games can be managed on a separate "Archive" tab
    - the game archive is accessible from iTunes so that archived games can be
      transferred to/from the iOS device when it is connected to iTunes
  - the game in progress is auto-saved when the application is put into the
    background so that the game is not lost if the application is subsequently
    killed for any reason
  - Play view now uses a grey instead of a b/w color scheme
- bugfixes
  - by default the GTP engine now uses 64 MB memory only; on an iPhone 3GS with
    256 MB memory this limit is sufficient that the system no longer kills the
    application because it uses up too much memory
  - application no longer hangs if GTP engine responds with error to final_score
  - capturing moves with a single stone now work correctly
  - pass moves are no longer drawn on the Go board
  - toolbar buttons on Play view now use an explicit text label instead of
    confusing icons
- technical changes
  - less view updates on the Play view, which means less power consumption and
    slightly snappier panning
  - add command processor design pattern
  - GTP commands can now be executed synchronously
