  - loading a game is now much faster
  - drawing, especially while moving a stone around the board, now uses 10-15%
    less CPU power, which improves battery life
  - Ko is no longer erroneously detected in certain situations (e.g. black has
    stones on A2, B1, B3, C1, C3, white has stones on B2 and C2; black now plays
    on D2, white on B2; in this situation, black C2 was erroneously thought to
    be illegal due to Ko)
  - profiles: "reuse subtree" is now always enabled (and cannot be disabled)
    when pondering is enabled; previously the two settings were independent of
    each other, which was a bug
  - loading archived game now works even if temporary file is still around for
    some reason
- technical changes
  - rewrite of Play view drawing code
  - lots of new unit tests

    would hang and needed to be manually killed to get into a usable state
    again)
  - capturing moves that "almost" create a Ko are now correctly recognized as
    legal moves (e.g. black A1, white A2, black D1, white B2, black C2,
    white C1, previously the black move on B1 was thought to be illegal)
  - it is no longer possible to place stones outside the board in the top-left
    and top-right corners
  - board size 7x7 no longer allows handicaps greater than 4 (selecting such
    a handicap previously would result in no handicap being set at all)
