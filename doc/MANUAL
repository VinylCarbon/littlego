Introduction
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Little Go is an iOS application that lets you play the game of Go on the iPhone
or iPad. If you don't know the rules of Go you can find an extremely short
introduction in the last section in this help (titled "Go rules"). For a more
thorough approach I recommend visiting one of the many websites dedicated to the
game; my personal favourite is "Sensei's Library" (http://senseis.xmp.net/).

You can play the game against another human (in "hot-seat" mode), or against the
computer. The "How to play" section in this help will provide you with a good
overview of what you can do when you see the game board. The computer player, by
the way, is powered by the open-source software library Fuego
(http://fuego.sourceforge.net/), which can be a pretty nasty opponent ☺ if you
tune up its number-crunching power. The "Players & Profiles" help section tells
you more about how to make Fuego stronger or weaker.

When a game is over you will usually want to know who has won. Unfortunately,
Little Go is not very smart about calculating the score - it relies quite
heavily on your help with evaluating which stones on the board are alive and
which ones are dead. The "Scoring" section has details about how all this
stuff is supposed to work.

When you save a game it will appear in the archive from where you can load it
again at a later time, delete it, or transfer it via iTunes to your computer.
Read "The archive" section for more information.

Finally, if you are interested in the way how Little Go and Fuego talk to each
other, you should study the technical information in the "GTP engine" section.



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How to play
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

===================
Starting a new game
===================
When you launch the app it displays the "Play" view with the game board and
automatically start a new game using the settings that you gave it the last
time you yourself started a new game. If this is the very first time that you
run Little Go, it will start with a few default settings: A 9x9 board, no
handicap, a komi of 6½ and a human vs. a computer player.

To start a new game yourself, tap the "Action" button on the right-hand side
of the toolbar at the top of the screen, then select "New game" from the menu
that appears.

===============
Placing a stone
===============
Start placing a stone by pressing your fingertip near the intersection where you
want the stone to end up. The stone immediately appears a short distance away
away from your fingertip, but is not yet placed. Drag your finger around the
screen until you are satisfied with the stone's location, then place the stone
by taking away your finger from the screen. Voilà.

If you are irritated because the stone does not appear directly under your
fingertip, you can change this behaviour in the preferences under
"Settings > Play view > Place stone under finger". You probably won't see the
stone anymore because your fingertip covers it, but if you watch the status
line below the game board you will see the coordinates of the intersection
where the stone is placed should you release it now.

===================
The computer player
===================
If your opponent is a computer player, it will take over immediately after you
have made your move. In the current version of Little Go you have to wait until
the computer player has made its turn before you can take further actions. In a
future version you will get the opportunity to interrupt the computer player.

If you want to do something else while the computer is thinking, you can always
switch to one of the other tabs (e.g. to read more of this help). If you would
like to get a notification when the computer has made its move you can turn on
audio/vibration feedback options under "Settings > Play view".

You may have noticed that Little Go has two pre-configured computer players,
"Fuego" and "Fuego (weak)". If you want to know more about the different playing
strengths of computer players you should start reading the "Players & Profiles"
help section.

==========================
Computer vs. Computer game
==========================
When you start a new game you can select two computer players to play against
each other. Only the black player's profile is relevant, so it doesn't matter
much which player you select to play white.

In a computer vs. computer game you can't do much more than enjoy watching them
battling it out ☺. If you want to interrupt the game you have to tap the "Pause"
toolbar button. Once the computer player whose turn it currently is has finished
its move, the "Action" toolbar button becomes enabled so that you can, for
instance, start a new game. Tap the "Continue" toolbar button to let the players
continue their match.

A computer vs. computer game is automatically paused when the device's screen is
locked, when you receive a phone call, or whenever some other interruption
occurs. Also note that audio/vibration feedback preferences are ignored in a
computer vs. computer game because you are merely a spectator and not actively
participating in the game.

=============
Other actions
=============
If you don't know where to play, or are just lazy ☺, you can let the computer
play for you by tapping the "Play for me" toolbar button.

If you are not happy with the move, or if you just wanted to see where the
computer would play, you can tap the "Undo" toolbar button. Of course, this
also works for moves you made yourself. Note that to be able to undo your move,
the computer player's move must be taken back as well. If the game is a human
vs. human game, undo will take back only one move.

Tapping the toolbar button with the "rows & columns" symbol will take you to the
Game info view. This view tells you all sorts of interesting things about the
game that is currently in progress. For instance you can see which player's
turn it is, but probably the most interesting part is the "Scoring" table which
tells you who would win if the game would end right now. Note that you need to
activate "Scoring" mode or the table will not display any territory scores. See
the "Scoring" help section for more information.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Players & Profiles
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

========
Overview
========
You can manage both players and profiles under "Settings > Players & Profiles".

There are two types of players: Human players and computer players. A human
player only has a name, while a computer player is additionally associated with
a profile.

A profile is a collection of settings, each of which defines a certain technical
aspect of how the computer calculates its moves. The combination of settings in
a profile directly influences the computer's playing strength. By associating a
weak or a strong profile with a computer player, you define whether it will be
a weak or a strong opponent.

To become active, a profile must be associated with a computer player, and that
player must participate in a game. If you make changes to a profile, those
changes will take effect only after you start a new game with a computer player
which uses the profile.

==============
Maximum memory 
==============
This setting defines how much memory in MB the computer is allowed to use for
its calculations. In general, the more memory it gets, the better the computer
will play. There are a few things that you need to be aware of, though:

- Most important is that your iPhone or iPad only has a limited amount of
  memory, and Little Go must share this memory with all the other applications
  that also run on the device. If iOS (the operating system running on your
  device) finds that Little Go behaves badly and uses up too much memory, it
  will terminate Little Go after a short delay so that the other applications
  can continue running. To make a long story short: If you increase the maximum
  memory setting, be extra careful to set a value that is not too high!
- More threads (see below) usually need more memory to be effective
- Faster processors need more memory because they can calculate more than slower
  processors in the same amount of time

=================
Number of threads
=================
This setting defines how many calculations the computer is allowed to make in
parallel. In general, the more threads it gets, the better the computer will
play.

However, the number of threads should not exceed the number of processor cores
that your iPhone or iPad has. At best, too many threads will have no detrimental
effect, but it may also be that playing strength suffers because the computer
is taking up too much time switching between threads when instead it could make
better use of this time in a single thread of straightforward calculations.

Note that the iPhone 4S is the first iOS device that has a processor with 2
cores, so on older devices you should leave the number of threads set to 1.

=========
Pondering
=========
This setting defines whether the computer is allowed to "think" while it is not
his turn. Turning this setting on allows the computer to play better because it
gets more time for its calculations.

Because the processor uses up more energy, this will also affect your battery
life, though.

=============
Reuse subtree
=============
This setting defines whether the computer is allowed to "remember" some of the
results of its calculations from the last turn. Turning this setting off forces
the computer to forget the results of its calculations once it has made its
move. On its next move it will then need to re-calculate some of the very same
results that it has just forgotten. Turning this setting on therefore makes the
computer play stronger because it can use its allotted time for making new
calculations.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Scoring
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

==============
Game info view
==============
When the Go board is visible, the toolbar at the top of the screen contains a
button with a "rows & columns" symbol. Tapping this button will "flip" the board
and instead display some information about the game that is currently in
progress. Probably the most interesting thing is the "Scoring" table which
tells you who would win if the game would end right now.

You will note that the final score is not really meaningful since the rows
labelled "Dead" and "Territory" do not contain any numbers. To count dead stones
and territory you have to activate Scoring mode

============================
How to activate Scoring mode
============================
To activate Scoring mode, flip back to the normal board view, tap the "Action"
toolbar button, then select the "Scoring" item from the menu that pops up.

Scoring mode can be activated at any time during normal game play, and it will
activate automatically when the game ends for any reason (e.g. two pass moves
in a sequence).

While Scoring mode is active you cannot play moves or perform any other actions
that influence the game state (exceptions are loading a game from the archive,
or starting a new game). To leave Scoring mode and return to normal game play
you can tap the toolbar button labelled "Done". If the game has already ended,
though, you cannot leave Scoring mode until you start a new game or load a game
from the archive.

================
Territory markup
================
When Scoring mode becomes active, Little Go (or better: Fuego in the background)
takes a moment while trying to find suggestions for an initial set of dead
stones. This feature is optional and can be turned off under
"Settings > Scoring > Find dead stones".

After the initial set of dead stones is determined, the board is divided up
into what Little Go thinks are black and white territories:
- Each color's territory is marked using a blackish or whitish translucent
  overlay
- Neutral territory is not marked at all
- "Inconsistent" territory (see further down) is marked with a red dot symbol.

===================
Marking dead stones
===================
You can now tap a stone to mark it (and its group) as being dead. Territory
coloring is immediately updated to display the new state. Note that the stones
you marked as being dead are displayed with a small red "x" in the center.
Stones marked as dead can be "unmarked" by tapping on them again, thus turning
them back to alive status.

Whenever you change the dead/alive state of one or more stones, the updated
total score is displayed in the status line below the game board. To view the
updated detail score you can flip the board over to the game info view.

===================================
Assistance with marking dead stones
===================================
If you have a game with many small stone groups that are all dead, marking them
will quickly become tedious. You can get a bit of assistance by turning on an
option under "Settings > Scoring > Mark dead stones intelligently".

From now on, whenever you toggle the dead/alive status of a stone group, Little
Go will help you by automatically toggling adjacent stone groups of the same
color to the same dead/alive status.

======================
Inconsistent territory
======================
If Little Go finds an empty territory where the state of adjacent dead stone
groups is inconsistent, it will mark that territory in a special way (a red dot
symbol by default). The definition of "inconsistent" is:
- There are dead stone groups for both black and white
- There are both dead and alive stone groups of the same color

The reason for marking up inconsistent territory is to give you notice that a
stone group has probably been erroneously marked as dead or alive. Feel free to
ignore the markup if this is just a transient problem while you are marking
several stone groups and are on the way to a consistent state.

If you don't like the "red dot symbol" way to mark inconsistencies, you can
change the markup type under "Settings > Scoring > Inconsistent territory".
The option "neutral" causes inconsistent territories to be marked as if they
were neutral territories, in other words: not at all.

For the purpose of calculating the score, inconsistent territory always counts
as neutral territory. This is regardless of how inconsistencies are marked up.

==========================
Area vs. territory scoring
==========================
The Go world knows two scoring systems: Area scoring and territory scoring.
Little Go currently only supports territory scoring.

Details about the two scoring systems can be found at
http://senseis.xmp.net/?Scoring


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Preferences
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
On the "Settings" tab you can set a number of user preferences that Little Go
will remember when the application is stopped and restarted.

This help section does not enumerate the different preferences, rather they are
explained in the appropriate context. For instance, all "Scoring" preferences
are explained in the "Scoring" help section.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The archive
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

=============
Saving a game
=============
When the Go board is visible, you can save the game that is currently in
progress by tapping the "Action" toolbar button and selecing the "Save game"
item from the menu that pops up. You must now specify a name, then tap the
"Done" toolbar button to actually save the game.

The default name for the saved game is always unique, i.e. there is no other
game saved under that name, so that you can quickly tap "Done" and be ready to
continue the game. If you accidentally type in a name that already exists you
will be warned and you can choose whether or not you want to overwrite the old
game.

======================
File sharing in iTunes
======================
You can transfer saved games to your computer via file sharing in iTunes:
1. Select the device in the sidebar of iTunes
1. Activate the "Apps" tab
1. Scroll down to the bottom of the page
1. Under the "File Sharing" section, you should see Little Go among the list
   of applications that support file sharing
1. Select Little Go to copy the saved games to your computer

Of course you can also do the transfer the other way round. Saved games by the
way are .sgf files that can be processed by many other applications.

====================
Managing the archive
====================
The "Archive" tab lists previously saved games, or games that were transferred
to the device via file sharing in iTunes. Tap the "edit" toolbar button if you
want to delete one or more saved games.

When you tap the entry for a saved game, a detail view for that game is
displayed. You can rename the game by tapping on its name. To load the game
tap the "load" toolbar button.

====================
Loading a saved game
====================
When you view the details of a saved game on the "Archive" tab, you will find
in the toolbar a button labelled "Load". Tapping the button will initiate the
procedure to load the saved game, which overall is very similar to starting a
new game from scratch. The difference is that you cannot choose board size, Komi
or Handicap, as these parameters are part of the saved game.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
GTP engine
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

======================
Overview and a warning
======================
The computer player in Little Go is powered by the open-source software library
Fuego (http://fuego.sourceforge.net/). Little Go and Fuego talk to each other
via GTP - the Go Text Protocol. In the GTP context, Fuego is called the GTP
engine, while Little Go is the GTP client.

On the "Diagnostics" tab you can observe the flow of communication between GTP
client and engine. You can even interfere with it by injecting your own GTP
commands. Be careful, though, not to disrupt normal operations: As the title
suggests, the "Diagnostics" tab options should only be used if something goes
wrong during normal game play and you need GTP to investigate.


=======
GTP log
=======
The GTP log displays the last 100 GTP commands sent, and the responses received.
The log size can be changed under "Diagnostics > Settings > GTP log size".
Commands are listed in the order in which they were submitted, the most recent
command appears at the bottom of the log. The log is dynamically updated when a
new GTP command/response is submitted to or received from the GTP engine. The
log can be emptied under "Diagnostics > Settings > Clear GTP log".

Each log entry displays the name of the GTP command and the time when it was
sent to the GTP engine. Log entries are also color-coded to mark which type of
response was received by the GTP client: Green means a "success" response, red
means a "failure" response, and a gray question mark ("?") means that the GTP
client is still waiting for a response.

The "flip" toolbar button can be used to switch between the table-oriented
view and the "raw" view of the GTP log.

The "new" toolbar button can be used to inject your own GTP command into the
communication flow between GTP client and engine. Tapping the button displays
a view where you can enter a command using free-form text, or you can select
a command from a list of pre-defined commands. For more information about this
see further down.

=======================
Viewing a GTP log entry
=======================
When you tap an entry in the GTP log, a detail view for that entry is displayed.
Most of the information you see here is already available in the log itself.
There is one more detail, though, and that is the detailed response string. Most
of the time the response to a GTP command just consists of the success/failure
status, but for some commands (e.g. "get_komi") the response contains more
information that is only available on this view.

The "+" toolbar button lets you add the command to the list of pre-defined
commands. If there is no "+" button, the command is already pre-defined.

====================
Pre-defined commands
====================
On the "Diagnostics" tab you can select the entry "GTP commands" to view and
manage a list of pre-defined GTP commands. Usually these are often-used or
complicated commands that you do not want to re-type every time you need to
submit them. Commands are submitted in the GTP log view.

The "edit" toolbar button lets you delete and re-arrange commands, while the
"+" toolbar button allows you to add a new command to the list. Tapping an
entry in the list presents a detail view where you can edit the command string.

The application comes with a factory set of pre-defined commands which you can
freely edit. To discard your current set and return to the factory set, select
"Diagnostics > Settings > Reset predefined commands".


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Go rules
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

========
Overview
========
This help section contains only a barebones and purely textual introduction to
the rules of Go. Usually a few illustration are much more intelligible,
therefore I strongly suggest that to learn the rules you visit one of the many
websites dedicated to the game; my personal favourite is "Sensei's Library"
(http://senseis.xmp.net/).

=======
Players
=======
The game is played by two players. One of them plays with black stones, the
other with white stones. Usually black makes the first move, except when there
is a handicap. This introduction does not cover handicap.

=====
Board
=====
The board is a grid of horizontal and vertical lines. The standard board size
is 19x19, but smaller board sizes are good for teaching games or solving special
Go problems. Little Go allows you to set a board size between 7x7 and 19x19.

=============
Intersections
=============
The lines of the board have intersections wherever they cross or touch each
other. Each intersection is called a point. That includes the four corners,
and the edges of the board. Stones are placed on points (intersections), which
might seem unusual if you are coming from chess.

=====
Moves
=====
Players take alternate turns. When it is their turn, they make a move. A move
usually consists of placing a stone. However, a player may also decide to pass,
in which case it is the other player's turn. If both players pass, the game
is over and the score is calculated to determine who has won the game.

Note that stones can only be placed on empty points. Also note that it is not
possible to move a stone once it has been placed.

=========
Liberties
=========
Each point (intersection) on the board has a number of lines leading away from
it to adjacent points. When a stone is placed on a point, the number of lines
leading away from it to unoccupied adjacent points are called its "liberties".

For instance, in the beginning if a stone is placed in a corner it has 2
liberties, if its placed on an edge line it has 3 liberties, and if it is
placed somewhere in the middle of the board it has 4 liberties.

Enemy stones that surround one of your stones take away liberties from that
stone. If your stone has no liberties left it is captured. The opponent removes
your stone from the board and places it in a box where at the end of the game
it can be used for scoring. The point where your stone was is now unoccupied
once more.

============
Stone groups
============
If you place stones next to each other so that they are connected through the
lines leading away from the points they occupy, they form a stone group. Stones
that are adjacent to each other diagonally are not connected through lines and
therefore do not form a stone group.

Stones in a group share their liberties. For instance, if you place a stone
somewhere in the middle of the board it initially has 4 liberties. If you now
place another stone on an adjacent point the two form a stone group and
together have 6 liberties.

Stones in a group must be captured as a group, i.e. the opponent must surround
the entire group and take away all their liberties before he can capture them.
If he succeeds, he captures the entire group and removes all stones from the
board.

============
Suicide rule
============
It is forbidden to place a stone so that it has no liberties. For instance, it
is forbidden to place a stone on a point that is surrounded on all sides by
enemy stones.

By extension, it is also forbidden to place a stone if it connects to a stone
group and the entire stone group would have no liberties left.

=========================
Exception to Suicide rule
=========================
The exception to the Suicide rule is: You are allowed to place a suicidal stone
if by placing it it takes away the last liberty of one or more enemy stones,
thus making liberties for its own.


=======================
No Repetition (ko) rule
=======================
It is forbidden to play a move which repeats a previous board position. This
rule prevents endless repetition in the face of alternating capturing moves due
to the exception to the Suicide rule.

Note that if some other moves are played in between, the same play may be
available again as a legal move, because it will not be repeating the same
board position.

This rule is also called the "ko" rule.

====
Life
====
Taking all the above rules into account, it is possible to form stone groups
that are impossible to capture under normal, alternating game play (also
assuming the defending player makes no mistakes). If such a group is formed it
is called "alive". A group that lives usually surrounds two or more separate
areas of empty points. These areas are called "eyes".

The concepts of "life" and "eyes" are not actually rules, they are just a
natural consequence of following the three rules about liberties, suicide and
ko. Nevertheless, it is essential to understand "life" and "eyes" to become
better at playing Go. Playing a few games, making mistakes and learning from
them usually is the best teacher.


===================
Purpose of the game
===================
The purpose of the game is to occupy or surround more points than the opponent.
When the game ends (both players pass), your score is calculated by summing up
the following:

- Number of enemy stones that you captured during the game
- Number of enemy dead stones on the board completely surrounded by your stones.
  Your enemy's stones are dead if they are not "alive", i.e. if they could be
  captured if you were to continue playing
- Number of points completely surrounded by your stones, regardless of whether
  they are empty or occupied by enemy dead stones

Your opponent's score is calculated in the same way, only from his point of
view. Whoever plays white adds komi to his score (komi is usually 6½ and is
given to the white player as a bonus to compensate for the black player's
advantage of first move).

Whoever now has the higher score wins the game.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Troubleshooting
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

==================
"Low Memory" alert
==================
If you see an alert titled "Low Memory" this is a sign that iOS just sent a
memory warning to Little Go, indicating that the application uses up too much
memory.

Almost certainly the cause for this is that the currently active computer player
profile has a "Maximum memory" value that is too high. You should find out which
computer player is currently active (on the "Play" tab select the game info
toolbar button), then go to that player's profile (under
"Settings > Players & Profiles") and lower the value for the "Maximum memory"
setting. A value of 32 MB should be OK even for older devices such as an
iPhone 3GS.

======================
Loading a game is SLOW
======================
This is a known bug. It will be fixed in one of the next releases of Little Go.

===================================================
I cannot load a game, the "load" button is disabled
===================================================
When you view the details of a saved game on the "Archive" tab, the "load"
button is disabled as long as the computer is busy thinking (either for itself,
or on behalf of a human player who has triggered the "play for me" function).
If a computer vs. computer game is currently in progress, you have to pause the
game for the button to become enabled. This limitation should be removed in one
of the next releases of Little Go.
