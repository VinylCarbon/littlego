Purpose of this document
------------------------
This document contains a list of minor features and technical stuff that should
be implemented when time permits it. The TODO list is updated frequently as new
ideas crop up during programming.

For a broader view of how the project will develop over time, you should see
the Roadmap document.


Priority 1 (important)
----------------------
- Fix build system
  - build-fuego.sh must apply the patch
  - Create three successive patches as outlined by the section
    "Changes to the Fuego source code" in README.developer
  - build-fuego.sh (or someone else) must create a symbolic link if the
    iPhoneSimulator base SDK version is different from the iPhoneOS base SDK
    version. This is *NOT* necessary if a way can be found how to specify these
    different base SDKs to Xcode. At the moment, it seems that both base SDKs
    always have the same value.

    lrwxr-xr-x  1 patrick  staff   22  1 Mär 01:35 iPhoneSimulator4.2.sdk -> iPhoneSimulator4.1.sdk
- Find out how to manage user input on a 19x19 board
  - Research in FreeGoban
    GobanGameDocument.nib
    - File's Owner = GobanGameDocument
      - Outlet grid = GobanView
    - Top-level Element is an NSWindow
    - embedded is a GobanView (GobanGameDocument.grid)
      - takes care of labels
    - embedded is a GobanBoardView
      - paints the background
      - seems not to be referenced from anywhere else
    - embedded is a GobanMatrix (GobanGameDocument.grid.matrix)
      - matrix contains 19x19 NSButtonCell
      - employs the mode NSTrackModeMatrix
      - sent actions: playStone -> File's Owner
- Find out how GTP works together with Fuego
- Document reviews before the release
  - INSTALL file
  - Create the NOTICE file
  - Add Copyright notice to the head of each source file
  - MANUAL file
  - README file
    - Under "License and source code" check whether the place to find the
      license in the running application is still correct
    - Under "Platforms" check the minimum requirements for iOS
  - README.developer file
  - ReleaseSteps file
- Contacts
  - Fuego team (on fuego-devel): Do they object to my using their source code?
    Answers to date: Only one developer spoke up, saying that he has no general
    objections as long as the spirit of the LGPL is in place.
- Give back to Fuego
  - information about how to build for iPhone
  - fix for the configure problem
  - improvements to the Autoconf/Automake configuration, i.e. optional creation
    of a unified library and optional installation of headers
