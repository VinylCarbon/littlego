Purpose of this document
------------------------
This document gives a broad view of the plan for future development of the
project. There is no time schedule associated with releases. It happens when it
happens :-)

In addition to this roadmap document, there is a TODO list that contains minor
features and technical stuff, ideas for which come up on-the-fly. If something
on the TODO list becomes important, it is possible to move it from there to
this roadmap.


The roadmap
-----------
Since this project is still in the inception phase, the following list is merely
an unsorted collection of ideas:

Requirements
- pass
- resign
- highlight last move with square/triangle/... symbol
- scoring
- Artwork
  - Application icon: Section of a go board with a couple of stones -> possibly use a well-known position
  - Stones: Black = circle with a flare in one corner. White = circle with a shadow in the opposite corner
  - Board -> A plain color should do (Tetsuki also uses this)
- Media
  - Sound for placing a stone
- build and include a Go engine
- GTP protocol
- tabs
  - Play
  - Archive
  - Settings
  - Debug
  - Help (?)
  - About

GUI notes
- From the templates available in Xcode, the "Tab Bar Application" template seems to match best. Tetsuki uses this, for instance
- Not sure
  - Utility Application (the Stocks example is horrible)
  - View-based Application (single view for the UI)
  - Window-based Application (to implement my own view hierarchy)
- Definitely not suitable:
  - Navigation-based Application (e.g. Contacts)
  - OpenGL ES Application
  - Split Viewâ€“based Application (e.g. iPad Mail, but I'm not using a master-detail arrangement)


Ideas:
- Save/load .sgf & allow transfer of these files
- Play sound when opponent (or myself?) plays
- Undo
- Let two computer players play against each other
- Various board sizes (9x9, 11x11, 13x13, 19x19)
- Handicap
- Komi (what is this if not handicap?)
- Ruleset
- Time-based play
- Byo yomi (what is this exactly? "x minutes for y moves")
- Reassign players (e.g. let's see what the computer does with my position)
- Show/hide Labels
- Show move numbers (inside stones)
- Let the user change strength of the computer opponent
- Hint
- Let users play against each other via network

Not to be included:
- Network play -> Refer to the excellent Tetsuki
