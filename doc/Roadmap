Purpose of this document
------------------------
This document gives a broad view of the plan for future development of the
project. There is no time schedule associated with releases. It happens when it
happens :-)

In addition to this roadmap document, there is a TODO list that contains minor
features and technical stuff, ideas for which come up on-the-fly. If something
on the TODO list becomes important, it is possible to move it from there to
this roadmap.


The roadmap
-----------
Since this project is still in the inception phase, the following list is merely
an unsorted collection of ideas:

Requirements
- pass
- resign
- highlight last move with square/triangle/... symbol
- scoring
- Artwork
  - Application icon
  - Stones
  - Board
- build and include a Go engine
- GTP protocol

Ideas:
- Play sound when opponent (or myself?) plays
- Undo
- Let two computer players play against each other
- Change board size
- Handicap
- Komi (what is this if not handicap?)
- Ruleset
- Time-based play
- Byo yomi (what is this exactly? "x minutes for y moves")
- Reassign players (e.g. let's see what the computer does with my position)
- Show/hide Labels
- Show move numbers (inside stones)

Not to be included:
- Network play -> Refer to the excellent Tetsuki
