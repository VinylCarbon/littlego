{"name":"Littlego","tagline":"Little Go. An iOS application that lets you play the game of Go on the iPhone or iPad.","body":"Little Go is an iOS application that lets you play the game of Go on the iPhone or iPad. You can play against another human, or against the computer. The minimum requirement for running this version of Little Go is iOS 5.0.\r\n\r\nFor a detailed description of Little Go's features, see the `MANUAL` document (also available in-game from the \"Help\" tab).\r\n\r\nIf you are interested in Little Go as a developer, you can either clone the source code repository [on GitHub](https://github.com/herzbube/littlego/), or download a release snapshot of the source code for one of the release tags. Release snapshots are also available [from GitHub](https://github.com/herzbube/littlego/tags). Either way, you should read the quick-start guide in `README.developer` to get up and running.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Changes in this release\r\n\r\nThis is the Little Go feature release 0.10.0. A large number of changes have been made, only the most important ones are listed here:\r\n\r\n* Improve graphic design (wooden background, new artwork for stones, new layout on iPad)\r\n* View board positions for moves played earlier during the game\r\n* Replace \"undo\" with \"discard move\"\r\n* A game that has ended can now be resumed\r\n* Redesign of \"New game\" and \"Game info\" screens\r\n* 3 new user preferences\r\n* Add support for collecting logging data\r\n* Drop support for iOS 4.3, the minimum required version is now iOS 5.0\r\n* Add iOS 6 compatibility\r\n* Add iPhone 5 support\r\n\r\nThe `ChangeLog` document has more details.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Known bugs\r\n\r\nSee the \"Troubleshooting\" section in the `MANUAL` document.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Links and resources\r\n\r\n* [Project website](http://www.herzbube.ch/littlego)\r\n* [App Store link](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/little-go/id490753989?ls=1&mt=8)\r\n* The source code respository is [on GitHub](https://github.com/herzbube/littlego/)\r\n* The bugtracker is also [on GitHub](https://github.com/herzbube/littlego/issues). If you want to submit a new issue there you must be a registered GitHub user (it's free and they won't bother you with spam!). Since version 0.9.0 Little Go also has a built-in bug report feature, which you can find on the \"Diagnostics\" tab. Last but not least, you can also email me directly.\r\n* On Little Go's [Trello board](https://trello.com/board/little-go/4fd84c295027333d460dcc32) you can see what I am currently working on.\r\n* Little Go also has an [Ohloh page](https://www.ohloh.net/p/littlego) that provides mildly interesting source code statistics.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Documentation\r\n\r\n* The source code is documented with Doxygen. The project is set up to generate the documentation with a a premade `Doxyfile` configuration file and an Xcode target that expects Doxygen and GraphViz to be located in `/opt/local/bin` (the standard MacPorts path).\r\n* A class diagram in the `doc` folder (a .jpg file) provides an overview of Little Go's core classes. The diagram was created with the free community edition of the UML modeling application [Astah](http://astah.net/). The model itself is in the file `littlego.asta`.\r\n* The end user documentation, which is available from within the game, is in `doc/MANUAL`.\r\n\r\n\r\n# License and source code\r\n\r\nLittle Go is released under the Apache License (2.0).
