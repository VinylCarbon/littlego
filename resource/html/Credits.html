    <p class="section" id="intro-section">
      It is important to me to acknowledge that Little Go would not have been
      possible without the help and previous work of so many other people. Most
      of them do not know about the app, but I would still like to thank them
      here.

    <p class="section-header">Beta testers</p>
    <p class="section" id="betatesters-section">
      <p>Thanks to the following beta-testers for their valuable time and
      feedback:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Martin MÃ¼ller</li>
        <li>Bruce V. Schwartz</li>
      </ul>

    <p class="section-header">The Fuego project</p>
    <p class="section" id="fuegoproject-section">
      Thanks to the <a href="http://fuego.sf.net/">Fuego project</a> and its
      developers, for creating a freely usable Go engine in the first place, but
      also for encouraging me to use their engine despite some legal
      uncertainties regarding the LGPL license.
    </p>
    <p class="section-header">Sen:te</p>
    <p class="section" id="sente-section">
      Thanks to <a href="http://www.sente.ch/">Sen:te</a>, for creating the
      beautiful app <a href="http://www.sente.ch/software/goban/">Goban</a> and
      making it available free of charge. Goban is one of my much-loved Mac OS X
      applications, and for a long time I had hoped that it would be ported to
      iOS. Alas, this never happened, so I had to come up with something of my
      own - the result is Little Go.

    <p class="section-header">The Sensei's Library</p>
    <p class="section" id="senseislibrary-section">
      Thanks to <a href="http://senseis.xmp.net/">Sensei's Library</a> for
      providing a wealth of information on Go that I could consult whenever I
      had any doubts about one of the rules and concepts of the game.

    <p class="section-header">Tetsuki and Goban</p>
    <p class="section" id="tetsukigoban-section">
      Thanks to the two iPhone apps Tetsuki and Goban (the latter <em>not</em>
      by Sen:te), for inspiration how to design certain aspects of Little Go's
      user interface.
    </p>
    <p class="section-header">Coders and bloggers</p>
    <p class="section" id="coders-and-bloggers-section">
      Last but not least, thanks to the countless coders and bloggers who freely
      share their knowledge and experience without regard to personal profit.
      Not only do we all, programmers and users alike, benefit from this
      enormously, it also shows us where we need to go to create a better world!
