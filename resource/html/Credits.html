      <p>Little Go would not have been possible without the help and previous
      work of many people. In particular I would like to thank those of you who
      have directly contributed to this project:</p>
      <dl>
      <dt>App icon</dt>
      <dd>
        Daniel Máslo, for crafting the beautiful app icon. To see more of
        Daniel's artwork pay a visit to his website
        <a href="http://www.danielmaslo.com/">http://www.danielmaslo.com/</a>.
      </dd>
      <dt>Stone artwork</dt>
      <dd>
        Justin Weiss, for giving me permission to use the stone artwork he
        created for his app
        <a href="https://github.com/justinweiss/dragongoclient">Dragon Go Client</a>.
      </dd>
      <dt>Go board wooden texture</dt>
      <dd>
        psdGraphics, for allowing the free use of their artwork in non-profit
        projects such as Little Go. The wooden texture that is used by Little Go
        to draw the Go board comes
        <a href="http://www.psdgraphics.com/backgrounds/light-wooden-background/">from
        the psdGraphics website</a>.
      </dd>
      <dt>Beta-testing</dt>
      <dd>
        Martin Müller and Bruce V. Schwartz, for their valuable time and
        feedback, which gave me the courage to publish the first version of
        Little Go.
      </dd>
      <dt>Bug reports and other feedback</dt>
      <dd>
        Andrew Hersee, Fabrice Heitz, Peter Waldispühl, Tripp Lilley, Valery
        Prikhodko, Horace Ho and Serge Grossenbacher,
        for their help with improving this app. No software is free of bugs, and
        Little Go woefully is no exception to this rule.

      <dt>Coding</dt>
      <dd>
        Jesse Rusak (for <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15370803/how-to-prevent-bounce-effect-when-a-custom-view-redraws-after-zooming">giving me the key hint</a>
        that solved my zooming problem).

    <p class="section-header">The Fuego project</p>
    <p class="section" id="fuegoproject-section">
      Thanks to the <a href="http://fuego.sf.net/">Fuego project</a> and its
      developers, for creating a freely usable Go engine in the first place, but
      also for encouraging me to use their engine despite some legal
      uncertainties regarding the LGPL license.
    </p>
    <p class="section-header">Sen:te</p>
    <p class="section" id="sente-section">
      Thanks to <a href="http://www.sente.ch/">Sen:te</a>, for creating the
      beautiful app <a href="http://www.sente.ch/software/goban/">Goban</a> and
      making it available free of charge. Goban is one of my much-loved Mac OS X
      applications, and for a long time I had hoped that it would be ported to
      iOS. Alas, this never happened, so I had to come up with something of my
      own - the result is Little Go.
    </p>
    <p class="section-header">The Sensei's Library</p>
    <p class="section" id="senseislibrary-section">
      Thanks to <a href="http://senseis.xmp.net/">Sensei's Library</a> for
      providing a wealth of information on Go that I could consult whenever I
      had any doubts about one of the rules and concepts of the game.
    </p>
    <p class="section-header">Tetsuki and Goban</p>
    <p class="section" id="tetsukigoban-section">
      Thanks to the two iPhone apps Tetsuki and Goban (the latter <em>not</em>
      by Sen:te), for inspiration how to design certain aspects of Little Go's
      user interface.
    </p>
    <p class="section-header">Coders and bloggers</p>
    <p class="section" id="coders-and-bloggers-section">
      Last but not least, thanks to the countless coders and bloggers who freely
      share their knowledge and experience without regard to personal profit.
      Not only do we all, programmers and users alike, benefit from this
      enormously, it also shows us what we need to do to create a better world:
      Work together instead of fighting each other!
