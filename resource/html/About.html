      <p>Most of the icons are by <a href="http://glyphish.com">Glyphish</a>,
      from the Pro icon set. If you need artwork for a project of your own but
      don't want to spend hours fumbling around with the Gimp, you should really
      check out this guy's work. There's also a free icon set, by the way.</p>
