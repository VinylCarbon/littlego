/// @brief The DocumentGenerator class parses a text file and generates a set
/// of HTML documents from the file content. The HTML documents can then be
/// conveniently displayed in a UIWebView.
///
/// DocumentGenerator assumes that the text file is structured according to
/// the following rules:
/// - The document is partitioned into sections; DocumentGenerator creates one
///   HTML document for each section it finds
/// - A section has a title and a content; the section title can be used to
///   refer to the HTML document in the GUI, the section content is also the
///   content of the HTML document
/// - The leadin for a section is a separator line that begins with 3 or more
///   dashes, i.e. "---"
/// - The single line below the separator is the section title
/// - If another separator line is found below the section title it is ignored
/// - All lines below the separator, until either the next section title or
///   until end-of-file, form the section content
///
/// DocumentGenerator parses the section content lines for a few patterns to
/// generate the following markup within the section's HTML document:
/// - Subsection titles
///   - A specially marked up title paragraph is created if a separator line is
///     found that begins with 3 or more equal signs, i.e. "==="
///   - The single line below the separator is the subsection title
///   - If another separator line is found below the subsection title it is
///     ignored
/// - An empty line, or a line that contains only whitespace, starts a new
///   paragraph
/// - Lists
///   - A line that starts with "- " starts a new unnumberd list, or a new list
///     item if a list has already been started by a previous item
///   - The list is terminated by an empty line, or a line that contains only
///     whitespace
///   - Ditto for numbered lists, but the line must start with "1. "
/// - URLs (e.g. http://) are used to create anchor HTML elements
