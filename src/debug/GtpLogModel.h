// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
/// @brief The GtpLogModel class is responsible for managing information that
/// records the log of the GTP client/engine command/response exchange.
///
/// GtpLogModel observes the application default notification centre for
/// notifications posted by the GTP client when it submits commands to, or
/// receives responses from, the GTP engine. These notificatins are delivered
/// in the context of a secondary thread. The notifications carry with them the
/// GtpCommand and GtpResponse objects which were used in the GTP client/engine
/// communication, and which are now evaluated by GtpLogModel to generate
/// entries in the log. Entries are represented by GtpLogItem objects.
///
/// Because regular clients access GtpLogModel from the main thread, but
/// notifications are delivered in a secondary thread, there is a potential for
/// thread safety issues. As a workaround, notification responders do not modify
/// any GtpLogModel members directly. Instead they invoke a second set of
/// responders in the main thread context, to which they then delegate all
/// processing of GtpCommand and GtpResponse objects. Delegate responders are
/// invoked asynchronously to prevent any deadlocks.
///
/// As a result, observers of GtpLogModel are completely decoupled from the
/// activities that occur around GTP client and engine. There is a guarantee,
/// though, that items will pop up in the log in the same order that commands
/// were submitted to the GTP engine.
