/// @brief The DebugViewController class is responsible for managing the debug
/// output view.
///
/// DebugViewController currently does nothing except logging all GTP commands
/// and GTP responses to a UITextView.
///
/// If the debug output view has not yet been created (because the user has
/// never switched to its tab), DebugViewController captures debug output in
/// a text "cache". When the debug output view is created, it is immediately
/// filled with the content of the cache.
///
/// @todo Research how much memory this controller and its associated view are
/// using. If possible, try to reduce the memory requirements. If necessary,
/// remove this feature altogether (only from the iPhone build?) and only log
/// to disk.
