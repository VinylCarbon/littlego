// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
/// @brief The GtpLogViewController class is responsible for managing user
/// interaction on the "GTP Log" view.
///
/// If the last item in the log (= the cell at the bottom of the view) is
/// currently visible, and a new item is added to the log, the view is
/// automatically scrolled to the bottom so that it displays the new item.
///
/// The mechanism how this automatic scrolling works can be described as
/// follows:
/// - If a new item is added to the log, GtpLogViewController learns about the
///   event from receiving the notification #gtpLogContentChanged.
/// - Automatic scrolling is therefore invoked by the (privately declared)
///   method gtpLogContentChanged:()
/// - Automatic scrolling is only invoked if the (privately declared) property
///   lastRowIsVisible is set
/// - lastRowIsVisible is set when tableView:cellForRowAtIndexPath:() is
///   invoked to request a cell for the last item in the log
///   - This happens correctly when the view is displayed for the first time,
///     and all items currently in the log can be displayed on a single screen
///   - This also happens correctly if the user scrolls towards the end of the
///     log and the last item becomes visible
/// - lastRowIsVisible also needs to be cleared when the user scrolls towards
///   the top of the log and the last item is no longer visible
///   - Here, things become a bit tricky because UITableView does not inform
///     its delegate (GtpLogViewController) when a cell goes off the screen.
///   - GtpLogViewController could tap into the UIScrollViewDelegate protocol
///     to handle scrolling, but this protocol is geared towards working with
///     view coordinates, instead of with table view cells
///   - For this reason, the logic for clearing lastRowIsVisible works as
///     follows
///   - Whenever tableView:cellForRowAtIndexPath:() is invoked and
///     lastRowIsVisible is true, it clears lastRowIsVisible as its first
///     operation
///   - The assumption here is that tableView:cellForRowAtIndexPath:() must
///     have been invoked because the user scrolled up or down
///   - If the user scrolled up, clearing lastRowIsVisible was the correct
///     thing to do because the last item in the log is now no longer visible
///     (or it is partially visible, but this amounts to the same thing because
///     automatic scrolling should now be disabled)
///   - If the user scrolled down (theoretical case only since the view is
///     already at the bottom, i.e. it already displays the last item), clearing
///     lastRowIsVisible was the wrong thing to do, but the mistake will be
///     corrected as soon as the code in tableView:cellForRowAtIndexPath:()
///     finds out that the cell for the last item in the log was requested - it
///     then sets lastRowIsVisible once more
///   - The assumption that tableView:cellForRowAtIndexPath:() must have been
///     invoked because the user scrolled up or down is wrong in one occasion:
///     It is also invoked when the cell for a single log item needs to be
///     refreshed
///   - GtpLogViewController learns about that event from receiving the
///     notification #gtpLogItemChanged
///   - The (privately declared) method gtpLogItemChanged:() therefore sets a
///     second flag - the privately declared property
///     updateScheduledByGtpLogItemChanged - to inform
///     tableView:cellForRowAtIndexPath:() that it has *NOT* been invoked
///     because of scrolling
///   - When tableView:cellForRowAtIndexPath:() finds that
///     updateScheduledByGtpLogItemChanged is set, it therefore does *NOT* clear
///     lastRowIsVisible as its first operation
