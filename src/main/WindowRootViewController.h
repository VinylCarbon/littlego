/// @brief The WindowRootViewController class is the application window's root
/// view controller. It is responsible for selecting one of several alternative
/// main application view controllers and displaying it.
/// WindowRootViewController has no visible screen elements of its own.
///
/// The application supports different UI layouts on different devices and in
/// different interface orientations. WindowRootViewController decides which
/// layout is appropriate for the current device and interface orientation,
/// then selects one from the several available main application view
/// controllers and installs its view as the main view of the application.
/// It then becomes the main application view controller's responsibility to let
/// the user navigate to the different main areas of the application.
///
/// WindowRootViewController is also responsible for defining which interface
/// orientations are supported on the device, and for handling changes to the
/// interface orientation. If such a change occurs, WindowRootViewController may
/// react by installing a different main application view controller.
///
/// @attention At the moment the same main application view controller is always
/// used once a UI type has been determined. The original plan to have different
/// main application view controllers for different interface orientations had
/// to be abandoned, at least for the moment, because it turned out to be
/// unreasonably difficult to return to the same view/view controller after an
/// interface orientation change. For instance, MainTabBarController is active
/// and the user is somewhere deep within the view controller hierarchy on the
/// settings tab. If the device rotates now, not only do we need to replace
/// MainTabBarController with MainNavigationController, but we also have to
/// return to the same view controller on the settings tab. This gets even more
/// complicated if a modal view controller is visible at the time when the
/// device rotates.
