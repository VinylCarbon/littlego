/// or because the user has cancelled the operation. Even if the report has been
/// submitted, the actual email may still be waiting in the outgoing mail queue
/// to be sent when there is again a network connection.

/// @brief The SendBugReportController class is responsible for managing the
/// process of sending a bug report.
///
/// The process consists of two distinct parts:
/// - Collecting diagnostics information in a single .zip archive that can be
///   attached to the bug report
/// - Displaying a "send email" view, pre-filled with all necessary information
///   and the .zip archive attached, so that the user only has to tap the "send"
///   button to send the message. The user can further edit the email message
///   before sending it.
///
/// Invoke sendBugReport:() to trigger the entire two-step process. The method
/// returns before the process has finished. To get a notification when the
/// process has finished you need to configure SendBugReportController with a
/// delegate.
///
/// Invoke generateDiagnosticsInformationFile() to just generate the file with
/// diagnostics information (part one of the whole "send a bug report" process).
