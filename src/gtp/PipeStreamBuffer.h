/// @brief The PipeStreamBuffer class is a custom I/O stream buffer that acts
/// as an in-memory pipe. PipeStreamBuffer was designed to enable two threads to
/// communicate with each other via a text-based protocol. There may be other
/// uses. PipeStreamBuffer is thread-safe but @b not reentrant.
///
/// @ingroup gtp
///
/// Two threads that want to communicate with each other bi-directionally need
/// two communication channels: The first channel going from thread A to
/// thread B, the second channel going from thread B to thread A. Both channels
/// have the following characteristics:
/// - The channel can be thought of as a pipe with two end points.
/// - Communication always flows in the same direction from one end point to
///   the other.
/// - PipeStreamBuffer forms the actual pipe that transports the data.
/// - An std::ostream object forms the end point where data enters the pipe.
///   The thread that is pushing data into the pipe is called the writing
///   thread.
/// - An std::istream object forms the end point where data flows out of the
///   pipe. The thread that is getting data from the pipe is called the reading
///   thread.
///
/// PipeStreamBuffer is used like this:
/// @verbatim
/// PipeStreamBuffer channel1;
/// std::ostream channel1_writeEndPoint(&channel1);
/// std::istream channel1_readEndPoint(&channel1);
///
/// PipeStreamBuffer channel2;
/// std::ostream channel2_writeEndPoint(&channel2);
/// std::istream channel2_readEndPoint(&channel2);
///
/// std::thread threadA(threadAMain, channel1_writeEndPoint, channel2_readEndPoint);
/// std::thread threadB(threadBMain, channel2_writeEndPoint, channel1_readEndPoint);
///
/// threadA.join();
/// threadB.join();
/// @endverbatim

  // gptr. The writing thread does not want to change gptr, so in theory
  // it could just call gptr() to obtain the current value - but gptr()
  // is NOT protected by mutexReadWriteLock because most of the reading
  // is done by the default implementation of std::streambuf, and that
  // default implementation does not use mutexReadWriteLock when it
  // advances gptr. It is, however, safe to check egptr() in the writing
  // thread because the reading thread (or maybe better: the default
  // implementation of std::streambuf) never changes this pointer on its own,
  // so there's no need to protect it.
