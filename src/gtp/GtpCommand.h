/// @brief The GtpCommand class represents a Go Text Protocol (GTP) command.
///
/// @ingroup gtp
///
/// GtpCommand is mainly a wrapper around a string that forms the actual GTP
/// command, including all of the command's arguments.
///
/// GtpCommand conveniently knows how to submit itself to the application's
/// GtpClient, thus clients do not have to concern themselves with where to
/// obtain a GtpClient instance.
///
/// GtpCommand can be executed synchronously (the default) or asynchronously.
/// In the latter case, a target object and selector may be specified that
/// are invoked when the response to the command has been received. This
/// callback always occurs in the context of the thread that the command was
/// submitted in.
