/// @brief The GtpClient class represents a Go Text Protocol (GTP) client.
///
/// @ingroup gtp
///
/// GtpClient communicates with its counterpart GtpEngine via named pipes.
/// When GtpClient is instantiated using clientWithInputPipe:outputPipe:() it
/// spawns a new secondary thread, then blocks and waits for GTP commands to be
/// submitted via submit:(). submit:() must be invoked in the main thread's
/// context; it returns immediately, while the command is processed and passed
/// on to the GtpEngine asynchronously in the secondary thread's context. When
/// GtpClient receives the response from GtpEngine, it posts
/// #gtpResponseReceivedNotification to the default NSNotificationCenter.
/// Clients that have registered for the notification are thus notified of the
/// response, again in the context of the main thread. The GtpResponse object
/// encapsulating the response is associated with the notification.
///
/// @note As a convenience, GtpCommand is capable of submitting itself so that
/// clients do not have to concern themselves with where to obtain an instance
/// of GtpClient.
