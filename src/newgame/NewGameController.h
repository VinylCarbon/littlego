/// @brief The NewGameController class is responsible for managing user
/// interaction on the "New Game" view.
///
/// The "New Game" view collects information from the user that is required to
/// start a new game. The view is a generic UITableView whose input elements
/// are created dynamically by NewGameController. The data for populating the
/// view is provided by NewGameModel.
///
/// NewGameController expects to be displayed modally by a navigation
/// controller. For this reason it populates its own navigation item with
/// controls that are then expected to be displayed in the navigation bar of
/// the parent navigation controller.
///
/// NewGameController expects to be configured with a delegate that can be
/// informed of the result of data collection. For this to work, the delegate
/// must implement the protocol NewGameDelegate.
///
/// The controller logic of NewGameController can be roughly described like
/// this:
/// - For each segment of the segmented control there is a separate set of
///   (private) properties that store the choices made by the user on that
///   segment
/// - When the user switches from one segment to the next these private
///   properties do not change so that when the user switches back to the
///   original segment it will appear exactly as the user left it
/// - The two public properties blackPlayer and whitePlayer, however, are
///   continuously updated to reflect the choices made by the user. When the
///   controller is dismissed, the delegate can thus access the two Player
///   objects stored in the public properties to set up the new game
/// - When the user wants to pick a new player she can only choose from a set
///   of players of the appropriate type (i.e. either human or computer
///   players).
