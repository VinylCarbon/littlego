/// "Edit Text" view that allows the user to edit a text string.
///
/// The "Edit Text" view is a generic UITableView whose input elements are
/// created dynamically by EditTextController.

/// EditTextController expects to be displayed modally by a navigation
/// controller. For this reason it populates its own navigation item with
/// controls that are then expected to be displayed in the navigation bar of
/// the parent navigation controller.
///
/// EditTextController expects to be configured with a delegate that can be
/// informed when the user has finished editing the text. For this to work, the
/// delegate must implement the protocol EditTextDelegate.
