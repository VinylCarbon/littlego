/// @brief The ItemPickerController class is responsible for displaying a
/// "Pick Item" view that lets the user pick an item from a list of items.
/// ItemPickerController is intended as an alternative to UIPickerView if
/// UIPickerView's style seems too "heavy-weight".
///
/// The "Pick Item" view is a generic UITableView of grouped style whose input
/// elements are created dynamically by ItemPickerController. The elements
/// are
/// - A number of table view cells that allow the user to pick one of them
/// - A "cancel" button used to end the selection process and notify the
///   delegate that no item has been picked. This button is placed in the
///   navigation item of ItemPickerController.
/// - A "done" button used to end the selection process and notify the delegate
///   that an item has been picked. This button is placed in the navigation
///   item of ItemPickerController.
///
/// ItemPickerController expects to be displayed modally by a navigation
/// controller. For this reason it populates its own navigation item with
/// controls that are then expected to be displayed in the navigation bar of
/// the parent navigation controller.
///
/// ItemPickerController expects to be configured with a delegate that can be
/// notified when the user has finished picking an item. For this to work, the
/// delegate must implement the protocol ItemPickerDelegate.
