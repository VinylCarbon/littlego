/// @brief The MagnifyingView class draws a provided UIImage so that it appears
/// as if inside a circular loupe.
///
/// The circular loupe effect is achieved simply by clipping the provided image
/// to a circular path whose diameter is equal to the size of the
/// MagnifyingView. If MagnifyingView is rectangular, the lesser dimension of
/// the rectangle is used as the diameter.
///
/// MagnifyingView also has several optional features to make the loupe look
/// great:
/// - A radial gradient that progresses downwards, from mostly transparent black
///   at the upper edge of the loupe, to fully transparent white in the lower
///   part of the loupe. This attempts to recreate the light distortion effect
///   of a magnifying glass.
/// - A border around the loupe
/// - A hotspot that marks the center of magnification
///
/// The radial gradient is the most difficult part of MagnifyingView to
/// customize. Things that need to be considered:
/// - Size of the magnified area. This influences the center and radius of the
///   gradient's inner circle. These can be adjusted by defining their vertical
///   distance from the bottom of the loupe.
/// - Lightness/darkness of the magnified content. If the magnified content is
///   very light (e.g. because of a white background) then the loupe can be
///   made darker than if the magnified content is rather dark. The amount of
///   alpha on the black color determines how dark the loupe appears.
///
/// This is how the radial gradient looks like, using overblown ASCII art :-).
