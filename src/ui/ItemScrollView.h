// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
/// @brief The ItemScrollView class provides seamless (i.e. not paginated)
/// scrolling through a finite number of item views. The item views are arranged
/// either horizontally or vertically.
///
/// ItemScrollView is designed to be used similarly to UITableView: It requires
/// that a data source (ItemScrollViewDataSource) provides the item views to be
/// displayed, and a delegate (ItemScrollViewDelegate) to handle all
/// non-scrolling user interaction.
///
/// Item views must all be of uniform width (if the ItemScrollView orientation
/// is horizontal) or height (if the ItemScrollView orientation is vertical) so
/// that the content size and with it the scroll bars can be properly
/// calculated. The uniform width/height that is advertised by the data source
/// is neither checked nor enforced when concrete item views are requested. If
/// the total width/height of all item views exceeds the calculated content
/// size, some item views are not displayed. If the total width/height is below
/// the content size, a part of the ItemScrollView remains empty.
///
/// In the other direction, item views should match the height/width of the
/// ItemScrollView. Item views that are less high/wide are placed so that they
/// align at the top/left of the ItemScrollView. Item views that exceed the
/// height/width of the ItemScrollView are clipped.
///
///
/// @par Memory usage vs. performance
///
/// ItemScrollView requests item views from the data source only as they are
/// needed: When it is initially displayed, it requests views until they fill
/// the entire visible area. When the user starts scrolling, ItemScrollView
/// requests as many views as are needed to fill the area that has become
/// visible through the scrolling action. Item views that are no longer visible
/// are removed from ItemScrollView, which means that unless someone else keeps
/// a reference to them they will be deallocated. This is to keep memory usage
/// low even if the data source has a large number of item views. The downside
/// of this is a certain performance overhead that may become noticeable if the
/// user is scrolling quickly and a large number of new item views needs to be
/// created in quick succession. For this reason it is recommended to make item
/// views as light-weight as possible.
///
///
/// @par Credits
///
/// This class is a complete rewrite of Apple's Street Scroller demo from their
/// UIScrollView presentation at WWDC 2011. The main goal was to generalize the
/// concept of a seamless scrolling view:
/// - It should be possible to scroll any type and number of item views
/// - Scrolling should be possible both horizontally and vertically
///
/// The original demo code can be found here:
/// http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/samplecode/StreetScroller/Introduction/Intro.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/DTS40011102
/// I found the reference to the demo at StackOverflow:
/// http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6736295/iphone-uiscrollview-continuous-circular-scrolling
