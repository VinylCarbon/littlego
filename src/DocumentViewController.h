/// @brief The DocumentViewController class is responsible for loading an HTML
/// resource file and displaying its content in the associated UIWebview object.
/// Alternatively, a client may provide the HTML document content as a string to
/// DocumentViewController upon creation.
///
/// The GUI has a number of web views that display different documents such as
/// the "About" information document. If DocumentViewController is instantiated
/// from a .nib file, it recognizes which document it is supposed to load by
/// examining the tag property of its associated view.
///
/// If DocumentViewController is instantiated via its convenience constructor,
/// it just displays the provided HTML document.
///
/// @todo Research how much memory this controller and its associated view are
/// using. If possible, try to reduce the memory requirements (e.g. only create
/// one instance of the controller/view pair instead of one instance per
/// document).
