/// @brief The GoScore class collects scoring information from a GoGame object.
/// The game does not need to be in any particular state, particularly not in
/// state #GameHasEnded.
///
/// @ingroup go
///
/// A GoScore instance operates on a GoGame object that was specified during
/// construction. Most of the scoring information is collected by simply
/// inspecting the state of GoGame and its associated objects:
/// - Komi is collected from GoGame
/// - The number of captured stones is collected from GoMove objects
///
/// The difficult part is calculating the territory score: Neither Little Go nor
/// the GTP engine are "clever" enough to find out which stone groups are truly
/// dead, which means that the user must help out by interactively marking
/// stones as dead or alive.
///
/// GoScore stores the information whether a stone is dead or alive in the
/// GoPoint objects associated with the GoGame instance it operates on. The
/// general approach is this:
/// - When GoScore calculates its initial score, it first asks the GTP engine
///   for a list of dead stones. It is expected that the GTP engine at least
///   detects dead stones surrounded by unconditionally alive groups.
/// - All GoPoint objects that have dead stones on them are marked accordingly
/// - All other GoPoint objects with stones are marked as alive
/// - Using this information, GoScore calculates its initial score
/// - When the user changes a stone group's dead or alive status, GoScore
///   records the new information in the appropriate GoPoint objects and
///   calculates the new score
///
/// @note GoScore currently only supports territory scoring without handling for
/// counting eyes in seki.
