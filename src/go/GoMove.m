// a point whose stone is removed (not relevant here) can mean only one thing:
// the stone on it, and its entire group, was captured
//
// a point that gets a stone can mean exactly one of the following:
// - the stone forms a new group
// - the stone is added to an already existing group
// - the stone merges 2-4 groups
//
// in addition, the stone may have split an existing region with no stones
// into 2-4 new regions
//
// stone groups that are captured do not form new regions, the points in the
// region simply change state
//
// liberty checks must be performed in the following order
// - if setting the stone decreases the liberties of a neighbouring group to
//   zero, that group is captured, unless there is a Ko state from the
//   previous round; a Ko state exists if
//   - the capturing stone is alone, i.e. it forms a single-stone group
//   - the captured stone is alone, i.e. it forms a single-stone group
//   - the captured stone was played in the previous move
//   - when the captured stone was played, it captured a single stone at
//     the same position that is now just played on
// - if no capture was made: if setting the stone decreases the liberties
//   of the stone's group to zero, the move is a suicide and therefore
