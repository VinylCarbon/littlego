/// @ingroup go
///
/// The main property of GoBoard is its size. The size determines the board's
/// horizontal and vertical dimensions and thus the number of GoPoint objects
/// that may exist at any given time.
///
/// GoBoard is responsible for creating GoPoint objects and providing access to
/// these objects. A GoPoint object is identified by the coordinates of the
/// intersection it is located on, or by its association with its neighbouring
/// GoPoint objects in one of several directions (see #GoBoardDirection).
