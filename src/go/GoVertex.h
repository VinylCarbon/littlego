/// @brief The GoVertex class stores the coordinates that uniquely identify the
/// intersection of a horizontal and a vertical line on the Go board. GoVertex
/// objects are immutable, i.e. they cannot be changed once they have been
/// created.
///
/// @ingroup go
///
/// Vertexes are given as human-readable strings such as "C13". "A1" is in the
/// lower-left corner of the Go board. The letter axis is horizontal, the
/// number axis is vertical. The letter "I" is not used.
///
/// A numeric vertex is a conversion of the compounds of a string vertex into
/// their numeric values. The number axis conversion is 1:1, but letters are
/// converted so that A=1, B=2, etc. The gap caused by the unused letter "I" is
/// closed, i.e. H=8, J=9. The compounds of a numeric vertex are bound together
/// by the helper struct GoVertexNumeric.
///
/// GoVertex supports values in the range 1..19 on both axis.
