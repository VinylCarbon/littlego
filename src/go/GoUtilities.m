/// @brief Moves @a thePoint to a new GoBoardRegion in response to a change of
/// GoPoint.stoneState.
///
/// @a thePoint's stone state already must have its new value at the time this
/// method is invoked.
///
/// Effects of this method are:
/// - @a thePoint is removed from its old GoBoardRegion
/// - @a thePoint is added either to an existing GoBoardRegion (if one of the
///   neighbours of @a thePoint has the same GoPoint.stoneState), or to a new
///   GoBoardRegion (if all neighbours have a different GoPoint.stoneState)
/// - @a thePoint's old GoBoardRegion may become fragmented if @a thePoint
///   has been the only link between two or more sub-regions
/// - @a thePoint's new GoBoardRegion may merge with other regions if
///   @a thePoint joins them together
