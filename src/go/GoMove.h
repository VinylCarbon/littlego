/// @brief The GoMove class represents a move made by one of the players.
///
/// @ingroup go
///
/// A GoMove object always has a type(); the different types of moves are
/// enumerated by #GoMoveType. A GoMove object is always associated with the
/// player who made the move. The player object can be queried for the color of
/// the move.
///
/// If a GoMove object is of type #GoMoveTypePlay it also has an associated
/// GoPoint object which registers where the stone was placed. The GoPoint
/// object is assigned (soon) after construction.
///
/// @note Assignment of a GoPoint object is a non-trivial operation that
/// triggers the mechanism for placing a stone.
///
/// GoMove objects are interlinked with their predecessor (previous()) and
/// successor (next()) GoMove object. This represents the fact that a game
/// can be seen as a series of moves.
///
/// GoMove has undo support. Invoking undo() reverts the board to the state it
/// had before the GoMove was played. Invoking undo() also removes references
/// from/to the predecessor GoMove, which usually causes the GoMove to be
/// deallocated.
