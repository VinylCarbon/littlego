/// A GoMove object always has a type(); the different types of moves are

/// color (see the black() property) of the player who made the move. In
/// addition, if a GoMove object is of type #PlayMove it also has an associated
/// GoPoint object which registers where the stone was placed.
///
/// GoMove objects are interlinked with their predecessor (previous()) and
/// successor (next()) GoMove object. This represents the fact that a game
/// can be seen as a series of moves.
