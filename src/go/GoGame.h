/// @brief The GoGame class represents a game of Go.
///
/// @ingroup go
///
/// Only one instance of GoGame can exist at the same time. This instance can
/// be accessed by invoking the class method sharedGame().
///
/// Currently the shared game instance is made available early on during the
/// GoGame initialization process so that other Go objects, which are also
/// created during GoGame initialization, may access the shared instance. There
/// is a todo with the intention to change this behaviour!
///
/// GoGame can be viewed as taking the role of a model in an MVC pattern that
/// includes the views and controllers on the Play tab of the GUI. Clients that
/// run one of the various commands (e.g. PlayMoveCommand) will trigger updates
/// in GoGame that can be observed by registering with the default
/// NSNotificationCenter. See Constants.h for a list of notifications that can
/// be observed.
