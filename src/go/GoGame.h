/// GoGame can be viewed as taking the role of a model in an MVC pattern that
/// includes the views and controllers on the Play tab of the GUI. Clients that
/// invoke one of the various "action" methods (e.g. play:()) will trigger
/// (possibly asynchronous) events that can be observed by registering with the
/// default NSNotificationCenter. See Constants.h for a list of notifications
/// that can be observed.
