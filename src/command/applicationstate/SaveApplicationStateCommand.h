/// @brief The SaveApplicationStateCommand class is responsible for saving the
/// current application state to an NSCoding archive so that the application
/// state can be restored when the application re-launches after a crash or
/// after it was killed while suspended.
///
/// SaveApplicationStateCommand stores the NSCoding archive in a fixed location
/// in the application's library folder. Because the file is not in the shared
/// document folder, it is visible/accessible neither in iTunes, nor in-app in
/// #UIAreaArchive.
///
/// The NSCoding archive is overwritten if it already exists.
///
/// SaveApplicationStateCommand executes synchronously.
///
/// @see RestoreApplicationStateCommand.
/// @see ApplicationStateManager.
