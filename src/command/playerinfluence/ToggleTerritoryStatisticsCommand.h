/// @brief The ToggleTerritoryStatisticsCommand class is responsible for
/// submitting a command to the GTP engine that enables or disables the
/// collection of territory statistics. Command execution occurs synchronously.
///
/// ToggleTerritoryStatisticsCommand looks up the current value of the
/// "display player influence" property in BoardViewModel to find out whether
/// statistics collection must be enabled or disabled. Statistics collection is
/// enabled if the property is true, disabled if the property is false.
///
/// ToggleTerritoryStatisticsCommand also initializes the territory statistics
/// in all GoPoint objects with the value zero and triggers a drawing update
/// of the Go board.
///
/// ToggleTerritoryStatisticsCommand is executed asynchronously (unless the
/// executor is another asynchronous command). The reason is that
/// ToggleTerritoryStatisticsCommand may be executed while the GTP engine
/// processes a "genmove" or some other long-running GTP command. In that case
/// ToggleTerritoryStatisticsCommand will block until the GTP engine has
/// finished processing the other command. ToggleTerritoryStatisticsCommand is
/// asynchronous so that the command processor displays the progress HUD while
/// the operation blocks.
