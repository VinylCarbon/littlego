/// @brief The RestoreBugReportApplicationStateCommand class is responsible for
/// restoring the application state from the information contained in a bug
/// report diagnostics information package.
///
/// RestoreBugReportApplicationStateCommand performs the following operations
/// to bring the application into the same state that existed when the
/// diagnostics information package was generated:
/// - Unarchive in-memory objects from the appropriate dump file that is part
///   of the diagnostics information package
/// - Enable scoring mode if necessary
/// - Load the .sgf file that corresponds to the current game into the GTP
///   engine
///
/// To achieve its task, RestoreBugReportApplicationStateCommand looks for the
/// diagnostics information package in a pre-determined folder (cf.
/// BugReportUtilities).
