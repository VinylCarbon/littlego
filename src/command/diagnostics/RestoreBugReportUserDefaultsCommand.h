/// @brief The RestoreBugReportUserDefaultsCommand class is responsible for
/// inserting those user defaults into the user defaults system that are
/// supplied by a bug report's diagnostics information package.
///
/// To achieve its task, RestoreBugReportUserDefaultsCommand looks for a user
/// defaults dump file in a pre-determined folder (cf. BugReportUtilities).
/// It loads the user defaults from the dump file into dictionary and updates
/// the user defaults system with all key/value pairs from the dictionary.
///
/// The current set of user defaults is overwritten by this operation.
///
/// @note As part of its execution, RestoreBugReportUserDefaultsCommand extracts
/// the contents of the diagnostics information file into a separate folder.
/// Since RestoreBugReportUserDefaultsCommand is the first command to be run
/// in a series that processes diagnostics information, the other commands
/// expect the diagnostics information folder to exist when it is their turn to
/// run.
