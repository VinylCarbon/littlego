/// @brief The LoadGameCommand class is responsible for loading a game from an
/// .sgf file and starting a new game using the information in that file.
///
/// The sequence of operations performed by LoadGameCommand is this:
/// - Submit the "loadsgf" GTP command to the GTP engine
/// - Query the GTP engine for the information that was stored in the .sgf file
///   and that is needed to start a new game
/// - Store the information in NewGameModel
/// - Start a new game by executing a NewGameCommand instance
/// - Query the GTP engine for other information that was stored in the .sgf
///   file (handicap, komi, moves)
/// - Setup the game with the information gathered via GTP
