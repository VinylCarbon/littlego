/// @brief The PauseGameCommand class is responsible for pausing a game with
/// fully automated play, where two computer players play against each other.
///
/// Even though the game is paused, the computer player whose turn it is will
/// finish its thinking and play its move. Pausing the game then takes effect
/// because the second computer player's move is not triggered.
///
/// This solution is necessary because there is no way to tell the GTP engine
/// to stop its thinking once the "genmove" command has been sent. The only
/// way how to handle this in a graceful way is to let the GTP engine finish
/// its thinking.
