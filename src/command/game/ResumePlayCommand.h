/// @brief The ResumePlayCommand class is responsible for resuming play after
/// the game has ended, allowing the players to settle life & death disputes.
///
/// ResumePlayCommand checks if the game rules allow non-alternating play on
/// game resumption. If not, ResumePlayCommand simply resumes play. If yes,
/// ResumePlayCommand shows an alert that lets the user select which side
/// should play first after the game is resumed. When the user has selected a
/// side, ResumePlayCommand resumes play and sets the color to move according
/// to the user's choice.
///
/// @note Because ResumePlayCommand may show an alert, code execution may
/// return to the client who submitted the command before play is actually
/// resumed.
///
/// If scoring mode is currently enabled, ResumePlayCommand disables it upon
/// resuming play so that the user can continue playing smoothly.
///
/// If after the game is resumed it is the computer player's turn,
/// ResumePlayCommand triggers the computer to play a move.
