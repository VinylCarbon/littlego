/// @brief The SetAdditiveKnowledgeTypeCommand class is responsible for
/// submitting a "uct_param_policy knowledge_type" command to the GTP engine.
/// Command execution occurs synchronously.
///
/// The additive knowledge type used as the command argument is determined by
/// looking at the device memory:
/// - If there is not enough memory, the rulebased knowledge type is used
/// - If there is sufficient memory, the knowledge type that uses Greenpeep
///   patterns is used
///
/// The threshold to determine whether the device has sufficient memory is
/// taken from the user defaults system.
