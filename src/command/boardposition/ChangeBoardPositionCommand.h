/// @brief The ChangeBoardPositionCommand class is responsible for changing the
/// current board position to a new value.
///
/// ChangeBoardPositionCommand is executed synchronously if the new board
/// position is 10 or less positions away from the current board position.
/// ChangeBoardPositionCommand is executed asynchronously (unless the executor
/// is another asynchronous command) if the new board position is more than 10
/// positions away from the current board position. To achieve this effect,
/// the various initializers will sometimes return an object that is an instance
/// of a private subclass of ChangeBoardPositionCommand.
///
/// initWithBoardPosition:() must be invoked with a valid board position,
/// otherwise command execution will fail.
///
/// initWithOffset:() is more permissive and can be invoked with an offset that
/// would result in an invalid board position (i.e. a position before the first,
/// or after the last position of the game). Such an offset is adjusted so that
/// the result is a valid board position (i.e. either the first or the last
/// board position of the game).
///
/// After it has changed the board position, ChangeBoardPositionCommand performs
/// the following additional operations:
/// - Synchronizes the GTP engine with the new board position
/// - Recalculates the score for the new board position if scoring mode is
///   currently enabled
/// - Performs a backup so that the board position can be restored when the
///   application launches the next time. The backup can optionally be disabled
///   by whoever executes ChangeBoardPositionCommand.
