/// @brief The DiscardAndPlayCommand class is responsible for first discarding
/// all moves in the future of the board position currently displayed on the
/// Play view, then playing a move.
///
/// DiscardAndPlayCommand looks at the current board position in
/// BoardPositionModel, then discards all moves in GoMoveModel that are in the
/// future of that board position. No moves are discarded if BoardPositionModel
/// is already at the last board position.
///
/// After moves are discarded, DiscardAndPlayCommand makes sure that the GTP
/// engine is synchronized with the new board position.
///
/// Finally, DiscardAndPlayCommand executes one of several possible play
/// commands. Which one is chosen depends on the initializer that was used to
/// construct the DiscardAndPlayCommand object. The following options exist:
/// - initWithPoint:() results in a #GoMoveTypePlay move made by a human player
/// - initPass:() results in a #GoMoveTypePass move made by a human player
/// - initPlayForMe() results in a move made by the computer on behalf of the
///   human player
