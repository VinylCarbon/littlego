/// @brief The ToggleScoringStateOfStoneGroupCommand class is responsible for
/// toggling either the "dead state" or the "seki state" of the stone group
/// that covers the intersection identified by the GoPoint object that is
/// passed to the initializer. ToggleScoringStateOfStoneGroupCommand also
/// calculates a new score.
///
/// ToggleScoringStateOfStoneGroupCommand currently does not save the
/// application state. Should the app crash the changed scoring state of the
/// stone group is lost, as is the newly calculated score.
///
/// It is expected that this command is only executed while the UI area "Play"
/// is in scoring mode.
