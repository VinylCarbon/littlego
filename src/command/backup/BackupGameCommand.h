/// @brief The BackupGameCommand class is responsible for saving the current
/// game to an .sgf file that is not visible in the archive. It also saves the
/// value for the current board position.
///
/// BackupGameCommand writes an .sgf file to a fixed location in the
/// application's library folder. Because the backup file is not in the shared
/// document folder, it is visible/accessible neither in iTunes, nor on the
/// in-app tab "Archive".
///
/// BackupGameCommand delegates its task to the GTP engine via the "savesgf" GTP
/// command. If the .sgf file already exists, it is overwritten.
///
/// BackupGameCommand executes synchronously.
///
/// @see RestoreGameCommand.
