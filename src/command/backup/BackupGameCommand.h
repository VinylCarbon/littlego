/// @brief The BackupGameCommand class is responsible for saving the current
/// game and application state so that a restore can be made when the
/// application re-launches after a crash or after it was killed while
/// suspended.
///
/// BackupGameCommand writes a primary NSCoding archive, and optionally an .sgf
/// file. The files are stored in a fixed location in the application's library
/// folder. Because the files are not in the shared document folder, they are
/// visible/accessible neither in iTunes, nor on the in-app tab "Archive".
///
/// BackupGameCommand delegates the .sgf saving task to the GTP engine via the
/// "savesgf" GTP command. Both the NSCoding archiveand the .sgf file are
/// overwritten if they already exist.
///
/// BackupGameCommand executes synchronously.
///
/// @see RestoreGameCommand.

/// @brief Indicates whether BackupGameCommand should save an .sgf file. This
/// flag is false by default.
///
/// This flag should be set only by actors who trigger a backup after a move has
/// been played or discarded.
