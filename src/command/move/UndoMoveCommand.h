/// @brief The UndoMoveCommand class is responsible for taking back the last
/// move made by a human player, including any computer player moves that were
/// made in response.
///
/// Undoing moves is not possible in a computer vs. computer game.
///
/// UndoMoveCommand submits an "undo" command to the GTP engine, then updates
/// GoGame so that discards the last GoMove of type #PlayMove or #PassMove that
/// has been made by any player. Resigning the game cannot be undone.
///
/// If the move that was discarded was made by a computer player, it is assumed
/// that this move was a response to a move made by a human player (this
/// assumption must be true by definition because at least one human player
/// must be engaged in a game that supports undo). The human player move is
/// then also discarded, in the same way as the computer player move.
