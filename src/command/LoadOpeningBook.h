/// @brief The LoadOpeningBook class is responsible for submitting a "book_load"
/// command to the GTP engine.
///
/// The opening book file used as the command argument is a project resource
/// with hard-coded name, i.e. there is no support for variable opening books.
///
/// @note If variable opening books are implemented, make sure to thoroughly
/// test file names that are not "book.dat", and files that do not contain
/// opening book data. Preliminary tests suggest that esp. the latter case may
/// not be handled properly by Fuego.
