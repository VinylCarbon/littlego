/// @brief The ResetPlayersAndProfilesCommand class is responsible for directing
/// the process of resetting all players and profiles to their factory defaults.
///
/// The process involves the following steps:
/// - Remove all players and profiles from the current user defaults so that the
///   registration domain defaults become visible
/// - Direct the involved model objects to reload their settings
/// - Start a new game using the new settings
///
/// ResetPlayersAndProfilesCommand does not display any alerts. It is the
/// responsibility of the client executing ResetPlayersAndProfilesCommand to
/// warn the user about the consequences of this action, and possibly to ask for
/// confirmation.
///
/// ResetPlayersAndProfilesCommand posts the following notifications at the very
/// beginning and end of its execution: #playersAndProfilesWillReset and
/// #playersAndProfilesDidReset.
