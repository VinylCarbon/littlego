/// @brief The NewGameCommand class is responsible for starting a new game
/// using the values currently stored in NewGameModel.
///
/// Starting a new game is a complex operation that can be broken down into
/// the following steps:
/// - Deallocate the old GoGame object (if it exists)
/// - Create a new GoGame object
/// - Set up the board in the GTP engine
/// - If at least one of the players of the new game is a computer player:
///   Configure the GTP engine with settings obtained from the computer player
///
/// A client may suppress some of these steps by clearing the corresponding
/// property flag before a NewGameCommand object is executed.
