/// @brief The DiscardAllSetupStonesCommand class is responsible for discarding
/// all stones that the board is currently set up with.
/// DiscardAllSetupStonesCommand first displays an alert that asks the user for
/// confirmation.
///
/// After it has made the discard, DiscardAllSetupStonesCommand performs a
/// backup of the current game.
///
/// @note Because DiscardAllSetupStonesCommand always shows an alert as its
/// first action, command execution will always succeed and code execution will
/// always return to the client who submitted the command before the setup
/// stones are actually discarded.
