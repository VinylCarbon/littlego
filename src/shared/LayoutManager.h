/// @brief The LayoutManager class is a singleton that provides information
/// about the user interface type and the user interface layout to classes that
/// are layout-aware, i.e. view controllers and possibly views.
///
/// As a convenience, LayoutManager adopts UINavigationControllerDelegate so
/// that it may be assigned as the delegate of a UINavigationController. The
/// only delegate method that LayoutManager overrides is
/// navigationControllerSupportedInterfaceOrientations:(). In the implementation
/// LayoutManager returns the value of its @e supportedInterfaceOrientations
/// property. The purpose of this is so that clients can create a standard
/// UINavigationController object, assign LayoutManager as its delegate, and use
/// it to modally present a view controller. By supplying the proper interface
/// orientations to the navigation controller, LayoutManager makes sure that
/// the user interface can be properly rotated while the modal presentation is
/// taking place.
