/// @brief The GtpEngineProfile class collects settings that define the

/// There is always one GtpEngineProfile object that is the default GTP engine
/// profile. This profile is the fallback profile if no other profile is

/// Circumstances where the default profile is used:
/// - If a game is started where both players are human
/// - If a profile is deleted that is still associated with a Player object,
///   then that Player object is re-associated with the default profile
