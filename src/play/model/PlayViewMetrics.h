/// @brief The PlayViewMetrics class is a model class that provides coordinates
/// and sizes of UI elements on the PlayView to clients that need them for
/// drawing.
///
/// If the frame of the Play view changes (e.g. when an interface orientation
/// change occurs), someone must invoke updateWithRect:(). If the size of the
/// Go board that is displayed by the Play view changes (e.g. when a new game
/// is started), someone must invoke updateWithBoardSize:(). If the display of
/// coordinate labels changes, someone must invoke
/// updateWithDisplayCoordinates:().
///
/// In reaction to either of these events, PlayViewMetrics re-calculates all
/// of its properties. Clients are expected to use KVO to notice any changes in
/// self.rect, self.boardSize or self.displayCoordinates, and to respond to such
/// changes by initiating the re-drawing of the appropriate parts of the Go
/// board.
///
///
/// @par Calculations
///
/// The following schematic illustrates the composition of the view for a
/// (theoretical) 4x4 board. Note that view has rectangular dimensions, while
/// the board is square and centered within the view rectangle.

/// The coordinates of topLeftBoardCorner, topLeftPoint and bottomRightPoint
/// are based on a coordinate system whose origin is in the top-left corner.
/// UIKit and Core Animation use such a coordinate system, while Core Graphics
/// uses a coordinate system with the origin in the lower-left corner. Also see
/// http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/2DDrawing/Conceptual/DrawingPrintingiOS/GraphicsDrawingOverview/GraphicsDrawingOverview.html
///
/// As a small reminder for how to calculate distances, lengths and sizes in the
/// graphics system: The coordinate system is zero-based, and the distance
/// between two points always includes the starting point, but not the end point
/// (cf. pointDistance in the schematic above).
///
///
/// @par Anti-aliasing
///
/// Most calculations are made with integer types. If necessary, the actual
/// drawing then uses a half-pixel translation to prevent anti-aliasing for
/// straight lines. Half-pixel translation is usually needed when lines have an
/// odd-numbered width (e.g. 1, 3, ...). See http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2488115/how-to-set-up-a-user-quartz2d-coordinate-system-with-scaling-that-avoids-fuzzy-dr
/// for details. Half-pixel translation may also be necessary if something is
/// drawn with its center at an intersection on the Go board, and the
/// intersection coordinate has fractional x.5 values.
///
/// A straight line of width 1 can be drawn in different ways. Core Graphics
/// can be observed to behave differently for the following cases:
/// - The line is created with a path. To prevent anti-aliasing, the path must
///   start and end at coordinates that have fractional x.5 values.
/// - The line is created by filling a path that is a rectangle of width or
///   height 1. To prevent anti-aliasing, the rectangle origin must be at a
///   coordinate that has integral x.0 values.
///
/// @note It's not possible to turn off anti-aliasing, instead of doing
/// half-pixel translation. The reason is that 1) round shapes (e.g. star
/// points, stones) do need anti-aliasing; and 2) if only some parts of the view
/// are drawn with anti-aliasing, and others are not, things become mis-aligned
/// (e.g. stones are not exactly centered on line intersections).
