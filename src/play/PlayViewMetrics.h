/// @brief The PlayViewMetrics class is responsible for calculating the
/// coordinates and sizes of UI elements on the Play view, and for providing
/// those values to clients that need them for drawing. PlayViewMetrics also
/// provides a few drawing helper methods because their implementation is also
/// calculation-heavy.
///
/// If the frame of the Play view changes (e.g. when an interface orientation
/// change occurs), someone must invoke updateWithRect:(). If the size of the
/// Go board that is displayed by the Play view changes (e.g. when a new game
/// is started), someone must invoke updateWithBoardSize:().
///
/// In reaction to either of these events, PlayViewMetrics re-calculates all
/// of its properties. Re-drawing of layers must be initiated separately.
///
///
/// @par Calculations
///
/// All calculations rely on the coordinate system origin being in the top-left
/// corner.
///
/// The following schematic illustrates the composition of the view for a
/// (theoretical) 4x4 board.

/// As a small reminder for how to calculate distances, lengths and sizes in the
/// graphics system: The coordinate system is zero-based, and the distance
/// between two points always includes the starting point, but not the end point
/// (cf. pointDistance in the schematic above).
///
///
/// @par Anti-aliasing
///
/// Most calculations are made with integer types. If necessary, the actual
/// drawing then uses a half-pixel translation to prevent anti-aliasing for
/// straight lines. Half-pixel translation is usually needed when lines have an
/// odd-numbered width (e.g. 1, 3, ...). See http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2488115/how-to-set-up-a-user-quartz2d-coordinate-system-with-scaling-that-avoids-fuzzy-dr
/// for details. Half-pixel translation may also be necessary if something is
/// drawn with its center at an intersection on the Go board, and the
/// intersection coordinate has fractional x.5 values.
///
/// Half-pixel translation may not be required if a CGLayer is drawn with its
/// upper-left corner at a coordinate whose values are integral numbers.
///
/// @note It's not possible to turn off anti-aliasing, instead of doing
/// half-pixel translation. The reason is that 1) round shapes (e.g. star
/// points, stones) do need anti-aliasing; and 2) if only some parts of the view
/// are drawn with anti-aliasing, and others are not, things become mis-aligned
/// (e.g. stones are not exactly centered on line intersections).
