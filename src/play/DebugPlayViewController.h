/// @brief The DebugPlayViewController class is responsible for displaying a
/// view with a number of input controls that allow to change the Play view's
/// drawing parameters that are normally immutable at runtime.
///
/// After each change the Play view is completely re-drawn to provide an
/// immediate visual feedback of the change's effects. Thus it is possible to
/// quickly test whether a change in the Play view drawing subsystem works as
/// intended.
///
/// The view set up by DebugPlayViewController is intended to be displayed on
/// the left-hand or right-hand side of the Play view when the device is in
/// landscape orientation.
///
/// TODO: DebugPlayViewController should be able to handle interface orientation
/// changes.
