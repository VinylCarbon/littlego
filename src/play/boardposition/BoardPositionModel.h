/// @brief This property is used to store the board position last viewed by the
/// user across application relaunches.
///
/// This property is updated to the current board position of the current
/// game in progress just before user defaults are written. This is guaranteed
/// to occur at the following times:
/// - When the application is suspended
/// - When the current game is backed up after a new move has been made
///
/// When the application terminates in any way, the value thus stored will be
/// read from from the user defaults when the application is launched the next
/// time. The value can then be used to restore the board position that was seen
/// before the application terminated.
///
/// @note Because this property is not updated on every change to the current
/// board position, an application crash may leave a stale value in the user
/// defaults on disk. A small amount of error handling is therefore necessary
/// when the board position is restored on application launch.
