/// @brief The BoardPositionToolbarController class is responsible for managing
/// the toolbar with controls to navigate the game's list of board positions.
///
/// BoardPositionToolbarController has the following responsibilities:
/// - Populate the toolbar with controls. This includes knowledge how the
///   controls need to be laid out in the toolbar.
/// - React to taps on self-created bar buttons
///
/// Some of the controls that are displayed in the toolbar are custom views
/// that are externally provided when BoardPositionToolbarController is
/// initialized. BoardPositionToolbarController is @b NOT responsible for
/// managing user interaction with these custom views - there are separate
/// controllers for that.
///
/// The remaining controls are a set of buttons that are self-created by
/// BoardPositionToolbarController. For these, BoardPositionToolbarController
/// also manages user interaction.
///
/// BoardPositionToolbarController can be triggered to repopulate the toolbar.
/// External forces need to invoke certain methods to indicate which controls
/// are desired.
