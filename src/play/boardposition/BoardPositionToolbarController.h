/// @brief The BoardPositionToolbarController class is responsible for managing
/// the toolbar with controls to navigate the game's list of board positions.
///
/// BoardPositionToolbarController has the following responsibilities:
/// - Populate the toolbar with controls. This includes knowledge how the
///   controls need to be laid out in the toolbar.
/// - React to taps on self-created bar buttons
///
/// One of the initializers is used to supply custom views that also need to be
/// displayed in the toolbar. The only thing BoardPositionToolbarController
/// knows about these custom views is where to place them in the toolbar.
/// BoardPositionToolbarController specifically is @b NOT responsible for
/// managing user interaction with these custom views - there are separate
/// controllers for that.
///
/// @note Custom views are used on the iPhone only.
///
/// The remaining controls are a set of buttons that are self-created by
/// BoardPositionToolbarController. For these, BoardPositionToolbarController
/// also manages user interaction.
///
/// BoardPositionToolbarController can be triggered to repopulate the toolbar.
/// This only has an effect if custom views are used.
