/// @brief The PlayView class is a custom view that is responsible for drawing
/// a Go board.
///
/// The view content is drawn in layers:
/// - View background
/// - Board background
/// - Grid lines
/// - Star points
/// - Played stones (if any)
/// - Symbols (if any)
/// - Coordinate labels (if any)
/// - Territory coloring (in scoring mode only)
/// - Dead stone state (in scoring mode only)
///
/// In addition, PlayView writes text into a status line and animates an
/// activity indicator, to provide the user with feedback about operations
/// that are currently going on.
///
/// All coordinate calculations are made with integer types. The actual drawing
/// then uses a half pixel "translation" to prevent anti-aliasing when straight
/// lines are drawn. See http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2488115/how-to-set-up-a-user-quartz2d-coordinate-system-with-scaling-that-avoids-fuzzy-dr
/// for details.
///
/// @note It's not possible to turn off anti-aliasing, instead of doing
/// half-pixel translation. The reason is that 1) round shapes (e.g. star
/// points, stones) do need anti-aliasing; and 2) if not all parts of the view
/// are drawn with anti-aliasing, things become mis-aligned (e.g. stones are
/// not exactly centered on line intersections).
///
/// @note All calculations rely on the coordinate system origin being in the
/// top-left corner.
///
/// @note All methods that require a view update should invoke delayedUpdate()
/// instead of setNeedsDisplay() so that multiple updates can be coalesced into
/// a single update, after one or more long-running actions have finished.
///
/// The following schematic illustrates the composition of the view for a
/// (theoretical) 4x4 board. See the private implementation of PlayView for
/// matching properties.
