/// @brief Updates Auto Layout constraints that manage the size and placement of
/// @a boardView within its superview. The constraints are added to
/// @a constraintHolder (which may or may not be the superview itself).
///
/// @a constraints is expected to hold the current set of constraints that
/// resulted from a previous invocation of this method. The current set of
/// constraints is first removed from @a constraintHolder. @a constraints is
/// then emptied and a new set of constraints is calculated and added to
/// @a constraints. The new set is then added to @a constraintHolder.
///
/// The generated constraints satisfy the following layout requirements:
/// - The board view is square
/// - The board view size matches either the width or the height of the
///   superview, depending on which is the superview's smaller dimension. The
///   specified interface orientation @a interfaceOrientation, not the current
///   view size at the time this method is invoked, decides which is the smaller
///   dimension: A portrait orientation means that the width is smaller, a
///   landscape orientation means that the height is smaller. The reason for
///   this approach is that during interface orientation changes the superview's
///   current size may not be accurate.
/// - The board view is horizontally or vertically centered within its
///   superview, the axis depending on which is the superview's larger
///   dimension. The logic that determines the larger dimension is the inverse
///   of the logic that determines the smaller dimension.
