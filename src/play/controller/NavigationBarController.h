/// @brief The NavigationBarController class is responsible for managing the
/// navigation bar above the Go board on the Play tab.
///
/// NavigationBarController is a container view controller. Its responsibilities
/// include:
/// - Populate the navigation bar with buttons that are appropriate for the
///   current game state
/// - Enable/disable buttons
/// - React to the user tapping on buttons
/// - Integrate the status view provided by the StatusViewController child view
///   controller into the navigation bar
///
/// The navigation bar that the user sees actually consists of 3 different
/// UINavigationBar instances:
/// - Left side: Contains some buttons
/// - Center: Contains the status view
/// - Right side: Contains more buttons
///
/// The center UINavigationBar is used only to provide the status view with the
/// standard translucent background appearance, making it appear to the user as
/// if there were a single navigation bar. On the iPhone the widths of the three
/// UINavigationBar views are dynamically calculated, to make room for longer
/// texts that can appear in the status view. This is necessary because the
/// screen width is so limited.
