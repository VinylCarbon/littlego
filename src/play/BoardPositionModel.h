/// @brief The BoardPositionModel class manages data related to the board
/// position displayed on the Play view.
///
/// Board position 0 refers to the beginning of the game, i.e. when no moves
/// have been played yet. If the game uses handicap, handicap stones have
/// already been placed in this position.
///
/// Board positions 1, 2, etc. refer to the position after move 1, 2, etc. have
/// been played.
///
/// Changing the board position via the @e currentBoardPosition property
/// automatically updates the state of all Go objects in memory (e.g. the color
/// of GoPoint objects is updated, GoBoardRegion objects are created, destroyed
/// and/or updated) so that the Play view can update itself to display the new
/// board position. Changing the board position in this way typically occurs
/// in response to user interaction on the Play view (e.g. the user taps a
/// toolbar button to view the next/previous board position).
///
/// Whenever the the board position changes, BoardPositionModel sends
/// #playViewBoardPositionChanged. It is expected that the Play view reacts to
/// this notification by updating itself.
