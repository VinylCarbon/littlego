/// @brief The PlayViewLayerDelegateBase class is the base class for all layer
/// delegates that manage one of the layers that make up the Play view.
///
/// PlayViewLayerDelegateBase conveniently defines and synthesizes properties
/// that store references to a metrics and a model object that will probably
/// be used by all concrete delegate subclasses. PlayViewLayerDelegateBase also
/// disables implicit animations that normally occur when a delegate draws into
/// a CALayer.
///
/// In addition, PlayViewLayerDelegateBase provides the following simple
/// implementation of the PlayViewLayerDelegate protocol:
/// - Synthesizes the property @e layer
/// - Provides an empty "do-nothing" implementation of notify:(). A concrete
///   delegate subclass must override notify:(), otherwise an instance of the
///   concrete delegate class won't react to any events.
/// - Provides an implementation of drawLayer() that invokes the layer's
///   setNeedsDisplay() method if the flag stored in property @e dirty is true.
///   A concrete delegate subclass that does not want to implement its own
///   drawLayer() may therefore simply set the flag to true during notify:()
///   if it wants the layer to be redrawn during the next drawing cycle.
