/// @brief The PlayViewController class is responsible for managing user
/// interaction on the "Play" view.
///
/// PlayViewController delegates handling of gestures to various subcontrollers.
/// PlayViewController directly reacts to the following user input:
/// - Tapping gesture on buttons that trigger a Go move
/// - Tapping gesture on the "Game Actions" button
///
/// In addition, PlayViewController manages the transition to and from the
/// "backside" view which displays information about the current game (including
/// scoring information). The transition is usually triggered by the user
/// tapping on a dedicated button. When the user wants to dismiss the game info
/// view, PlayViewController transitions back to the "frontside" view, which is
/// the main play view.
///
///
/// @par Interface rotation
///
/// Most of the "Play" view is automatically resized when an interface
/// orientation occurs, due to autoresizeMask being properly set on most of the
/// view's UI elements. There are, however, the following exceptions:
/// - At any given time, either the "frontside" or the "backside" view are not
///   part of the view hierarchy because they are not visible at that time.
///   If the interface is rotated, the view that is currently not part of the
///   view hierarchy is not automatically resized. PlayViewController makes
///   sure that the resize happens nonetheless.
/// - The autoresizeMask of PlayView does not allow the view to grow or shrink.
///   PlayViewController makes sure that whenever the "frontside" view is
///   resized, PlayView is also resized. If the "frontside" view is visible at
///   that time, the resize is animated.
///
/// PlayViewController makes sure that all size updates described above are
/// performed even if the "Play" view is not visible at the time the interface
/// rotates. This requires special code because PlayViewController's regular
/// rotation code is not triggered by UIKit in this situation.
