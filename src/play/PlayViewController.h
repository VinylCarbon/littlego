/// @brief The PlayViewController class is responsible for managing user
/// interaction on the "Play" view.
///
/// PlayViewController reacts to the following user input:
/// - Dragging, or panning, gesture in the view's Go board area
///   This is used to place a stone on the board.
/// - Tapping gesture on buttons that trigger a Go move
/// - Tapping gesture on the "Game Actions" button
///
/// In addition, PlayViewController manages the transition to and from the
/// "backside" view which displays information about the current game (including
/// scoring information). The transition is usually triggered by the user
/// tapping on a dedicated button. When the user wants to dismiss the game info
/// view, PlayViewController transitions back to the "frontside" view, which is
/// the main play view.
