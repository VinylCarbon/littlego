/// @brief The PlayViewController class is the main controller on the "Play"
/// tab. It does not manage user interaction on its own, instead it delegates
/// this task to a variety of other sub-controllers.
///
/// PlayViewController has the following responsibilities:
/// - Set up the view hierarchy on the "Play" tab
/// - Create and configure sub-controllers
/// - Manage the timing of these tasks during application launch
/// - Manage the transition to and from the Game Info view. The transition is
///   triggered by a sub-controller, but managed by PlayViewController because
///   only PlayViewController knows the details of the view hierarchy
/// - Display alerts that are used by more than one sub-controller
///
///
/// @par Interface rotation
///
/// PlayViewController sets up all views on the "Play" tab with an appropriate
/// autoresizing mask so that when the interface rotates UIKit automatically
/// resizes and shifts the views.
