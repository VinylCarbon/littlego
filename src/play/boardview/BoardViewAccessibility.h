// -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
/// @brief The BoardViewAccessibility class is used by the BoardView class to
/// handle accessibility related stuff.
///
/// UI testing is based on the accessibility API that is deeply embedded in
/// UIKit. Because graphical board elements are drawn via CoreGraphics, not via
/// UIKit, these elements are not exposed to the accessibility layer and are
/// thus not available for UI testing.
///
/// The solution for this problem is that BoardView acts as a
/// UIAccessibilityContainer, exposing an array of UIAccessibilityElement
/// objects to the accessibility layer and thus to UI tests. BoardView delegates
/// the actual work for assembling the array of UIAccessibilityElement objects
/// to BoardViewAccessibility.
///
/// BoardViewAccessibility is also responsible for notifying the accessibility
/// layer when the content of the array changes.
