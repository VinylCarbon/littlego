/// @brief The PlayViewLayerDelegateBase class is the base class for all layer
/// delegates that manage one of the layers that make up the Play view.
///
/// PlayViewLayerDelegateBase conveniently defines a property that stores a
/// reference to a metrics object that will probably be used by all concrete
/// delegate subclasses. PlayViewLayerDelegateBase also disables implicit
/// animations that normally occur when a delegate draws into a CALayer.
///
/// In addition, PlayViewLayerDelegateBase provides the following simple
/// implementation of the PlayViewLayerDelegate protocol:
/// - Defines the properties @e layer and @e mainView
/// - In its initializer, creates a new CALayer object, adds it as a sublayer
///   to @e mainView, and configures the layer object to use the
///   PlayViewLayerDelegateBase as its delegate.
/// - Provides an empty "do-nothing" implementation of notify:eventInfo:().
///   A concrete delegate subclass must override notify:eventInfo:(), otherwise
///   an instance of the concrete delegate class won't react to any events.
/// - Provides an implementation of drawLayer() that invokes the layer's
///   setNeedsDisplay() method if the flag stored in property @e dirty is true.
///   A concrete delegate subclass that does not want to implement its own
///   drawLayer() may therefore simply set the flag to true during
///   notify:eventInfo:() if it wants the layer to be redrawn during the next
///   drawing cycle.
