/// @brief The EditPlayerController class is responsible for managing user
/// interaction on the "Edit/New Player" view.
///
/// The "Edit/New Player" view allows the user to edit the information
/// associated with a Player object. The view is a generic UITableView whose
/// input elements are created dynamically by EditPlayerController. The
/// controller runs in one of two modes, depending on which convenience
/// constructor is used to create the controller instance:
/// - Create mode: The player whose attributes are edited does not exist yet,
///   the user must tap a "create" button to confirm that the player should be
///   created.
/// - Edit mode: The player whose attributes are edited already exists. Changes
///   cannot be undone, they are immediately written to the Player model object.
///
/// EditPlayerController expects to be displayed by a navigation controller,
/// either presented modally or pushed on the controller's navigation stack. For
/// this reason it populates its own navigation item with controls that are
/// then expected to be displayed in the navigation bar of the parent
/// navigation controller.
///
/// EditPlayerController expects to be configured with a delegate that can be
/// informed when the user makes any changes. For this to work, the delegate
/// must implement the protocol EditPlayerDelegate.
